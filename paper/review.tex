\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

The construction of effective numerical glacier and ice sheet models is challenging for two fundamental reasons.  First is the complexity of the equations and boundary conditions.  Indeed, the physics of glaciers is nonlinear, nontrivially-coupled, and subject to imperfectly-understood boundary processes, such as contact with ocean water.  The coupling is critical in the sense that mass, momentum, and energy conservation interact in ways which are relevant to glaciological modeling goals, such as when basal sliding, and thus ice velocity, is only determined though a simultaneous momentum and energy solution.  Second, the geometry of glaciers and ice sheets is complex, and in particular the fastest-flowing parts of ice sheets are often located at the geometrically-nontrivial lateral boundary where fjord-like bed geometry is also common.  Numerical models therefore need to perform expensive fine-mesh calculations, so as to accomodate the complicated, changing boundary geometry, while solving relatively-complicated multiphysics equations.

On the other hand, since the 1980s researchers in numerial methods have developed multigrid methods to solve partial differential equations like those which describe the ice fluid in glaciers.   For simpler problems like scalar elliptic equations and the linear Stokes system, especially on domains which have a simpler geometry, these methods are now in routine use \cite{Briggsetal2000,Bueler2021,Trottenbergetal2001}.

FIXME Accessible introductions to FE methods are in \cite{Bueler2021,Elmanetal2014,Johnson2009}.  Closest to our view in section \ref{sec:subspace} is \cite[Chapter V]{Braess2007}

FIXME cite for multigrid on classical obstacle \cite{BrandtCryer1983,Bueler2021,GraeserKornhuber2009}

A brief historical summary of the SIA problem may be helpful.  The model was first solved by a finite difference scheme in \cite{Mahaffy1976}, and FE solutions are given in \cite{Calvoetal2002,JouvetBueler2012} among other places.  In fact, large-scale numerical applications of this model are common, and for examples see the high-resolution Greenland ice sheet model in section 4.2 of \cite{Bueler2016}, or the SIA applications as hybrid ice sheet model components \cite[for example]{Winkelmannetal2011}.  The idea that the glacier geometry solves an obstacle problem was introduced by \cite{Calvoetal2002} in the time-dependent, flat-bed case.  Existence was extended to non-flat beds by \cite{JouvetBueler2012}.  However, none of these references use multilevel methods.  Such methods were first applied by Jouvet and others \cite{Jouvetetal2013}, with further results in \cite{JouvetGraeser2013}, using a truncated non-smooth Newton multigrid method which tracks the inactive set \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009}.


\section{Geometric multigrid for a Poisson problem} \label{sec:subspace}

\subsection{Finite elements for a simple differential equation} \label{subsec:poissonfe}  In this section we will consider how to solve a simple differential equation, namely a linear Poisson-like problem
\begin{equation}
- \big(\alpha(x)\,u'(x)\big)' = f(x) \quad \text{on} \quad 0 \le x \le 1, \label{eq:poisson}
\end{equation}
with Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(0)=u(1)=0$, using a finite element discretization and a multigrid method.  The data $\alpha(x)$ and $f(x)$ are assumed to be sufficiently well-behaved for the computations which follow, and we assume $\alpha(x)$ is bounded and positive so the problem is elliptic \cite{Evans2010}: $0 < c_1 \le \alpha(x) \le c_2$.  Over the course of the next three sections, this simple problem will evolve into a realistic model for glacier geometry.

Our numerical approximation of \eqref{eq:poisson} uses a mesh of $m$ interior \emph{nodes} (points) $x_p$ on $(0,1)$.  The $m+1$ intervals between the nodes are the \emph{elements}.  The numerical solution $u^h(x)$ is a linear combination of the piecewise-linear \emph{hat functions} $\psi_p(x)$, shown in Figure \ref{fig:finehats}, one for each interior node:
\begin{equation}
u^h(x) = \sum_{p=1}^m u_p \psi_p(x). \label{eq:trialsolution}
\end{equation}
Each hat function $\psi_p(x)$ is continuous on $[0,1]$, linear on each element, and satisfies $\psi_p(x_q) = \delta_{pq}$.  Note that the derivative of $u^h(x)$ is well-defined on the elements, thus almost everywhere, but not at the nodes.

Let $\mathcal{V}^h$ be the space of continuous and piecewise-linear functions.  The set $\{\psi_p(x)\}_{p=1}^m$ is a \emph{nodal basis} of $\mathcal{V}^h$ because the coefficients equal the function values, i.e.~$u_p=u^h(x_p)$.  In a computer program these coefficients will be formed into a (column) vector $\bu=\{u_p\}$ in $\RR^m$.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{genfigs/finehats.pdf}
\caption{Hat functions $\psi_p(x)$ at interior points $x_p$ form a basis for a vector space $\mathcal{V}^h$ of piecewise-linear functions.}
\label{fig:finehats}
\end{figure}

As usual for numerical solutions of differential equations, we are interested in the fine-mesh limit where $m$ is large.  However, what is the need for a high-resolution mesh in practice, i.e.~a large value of $m$ and small spacing between the nodes $x_p$?  For an ice sheet model, the need is obvious: a high-resolution mesh can capture realistically-bumpy bed topography and/or spatially-varying climatic mass-balance with large, local variations.  These inputs roughly correspond in problem \eqref{eq:poisson} to variations in the coefficient function $\alpha(x)$ and the source function $f(x)$, respectively.  That is, we want a high-resolution mesh to capture the fine scales in the model input data.  In addition, as address in sections \ref{sec:obstacle}--\ref{sec:stokes}, a fine mesh will allow precise modeling of glacier extent and glacier margin location.

Our application of multigrid ideas to glacier problems will use finite element (FE) concepts, and therefore we must rephrase \eqref{eq:poisson} into \emph{weak form} using integrals.  (The original equation will then be called the \emph{strong form}.)  To do this we suppose that the solution $u(x)$ comes from a vector space $\mathcal{H}$ of functions which have values of zero at $x=0$ and $x=1$, and which are smooth enough to make sense in what follows.  While we will not over-use mathematical language, in fact $\mathcal{H}=H_0^1[0,1]=W_0^{1,2}[0,1]$ is a Hilbert and Sobolev space \cite[for example]{Evans2010} consisting of functions with one square-integrable derivative.  Also, we assume $\alpha(x)$ is in $L^\infty[0,1]$ and $f(x)$ in $L^2[0,1]$.

The weak form arises by multiplying both sides of \eqref{eq:poisson} by a \emph{test function} from $\mathcal{H}$ and integrating by parts so that only first derivatives remain.  Denoting the test function as $v(x)$, integrating on $[0,1]$, and using $v(0)=v(1)=0$, we find
\begin{equation}
\int_0^1 \alpha(x) u'(x) v'(x)\,dx = \int_0^1 f(x) v(x)\, dx.  \label{eq:weakpoissonearly}
\end{equation}
We now write this equation more compactly as
\begin{equation}
  a(u,v) = \ip{f}{v}, \label{eq:weakpoisson}
\end{equation}
defining each side as in \eqref{eq:weakpoissonearly}; we seek $u$ in $\mathcal{H}$ so that \eqref{eq:weakpoisson} holds for all $v$ in $\mathcal{H}$.  The left side $a(u,v)$ is linear in each argument (\emph{bilinear}) while the right side defines a \emph{linear functional} $\ell[v] = \ip{f}{v}$ acting on $v$ in $\mathcal{H}$.  The convenience of such abstract notation will become clearer as we describe multilevel algorithms.

Our FE method seeks a solution $u^h$ in $\mathcal{V}^h$ of the same weak form \eqref{eq:weakpoisson}.  The problem is now finite-dimensional:
\begin{equation}
  a(u^h,v) = \ip{f}{v},  \label{eq:feweakpoisson}
\end{equation}
for all test functions $v$ in $\mathcal{V}^h$.  Because $\mathcal{V}^h$ is a subset of $\mathcal{H}$, we can compare $u^h$ and $u$.  In fact, by subtracting \eqref{eq:feweakpoisson} from \eqref{eq:weakpoisson} we see that the \emph{numerical error} $u-u^h$ satisfies $a(u-u^h,v)=0$ for all $v$ in $\mathcal{V}^h$.  That is, the numerical error is orthogonal, in the sense of $a(\cdot,\cdot)$, to the finite-dimensional subspace $\mathcal{V}^h$.  Standard FE arguments then show that the error goes to zero as $h$ goes to zero \cite{Braess2007,Elmanetal2014}.

One may substitute formula \eqref{eq:trialsolution} for $u^h$ into \eqref{eq:feweakpoisson} to derive a linear system
\begin{equation}
A \bu = \bbf, \label{eq:linearsystem}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is an $m\times m$ matrix and $\bbf$ is in $\RR^m$.  Each equation (row) in system \eqref{eq:linearsystem} is constructed by using a hat function as a test function; substitution of $v=\psi_p$ gives the $p$th equation.  The matrix $A$, which has entries $a_{pq} = a(\psi_p,\psi_q)$, is symmetric and positive definite.  For the right side one defines entries $f_p = \ip{f}{\psi_p}$ to form the vector $\bbf = \{f_p\}$.  For the 1D problem here, only three values $a_{p,p-1}, a_{p,p}, a_{p,p+1}$ are nonzero in row $p$, so $A$ is tridiagonal.  Writing these entries in detail may remind the reader of finite difference approximations of the Laplacian.

Depending on the form of $\alpha(x)$, the matrix entries
\begin{equation}
  a_{pq} = \int_0^1 \alpha(x) \psi_p'(x) \psi_q'(x)\,dx \label{eq:poissonentries}
\end{equation}
may be computed exactly or approximately by quadrature.  Similar considerations apply to the values $f_p = \int_0^1 f(x) \psi_p(x)\,dx$.  The errors arising from quadrature have only a slight effect on the accuracy of the whole FE method \cite{Braess2007}.

The most straightforward way to solve assembled linear system \eqref{eq:linearsystem} would be via a ``direct'' method like Gaussian elimination.  In 2D and 3D problems, where the number of unknowns $m$ is large, such direct methods need many more that $O(m)$ operations to solve the system, while, as noted in the introduction, high-resolution ice sheet applications demand optimal $O(m)$ solution methods, or nearly so.  Furthermore, excluding the current section, all of our problems will be nonlinear, thus no finite-time direct method will be available anyway.  Thus we will not assemble matrices, but instead construct rapidly-convergent iterations using easy-to-implement pointwise iterations and multiple mesh levels.

Our solution methods will be phrased in terms of ``residuals'', which need to be clearly defined.  Suppose $w$ in $\mathcal{V}^h$ is any estimate of the solution $u^h$ of \eqref{eq:feweakpoisson}.  We define the \emph{residual} of $w$ as a linear functional acting on $v$ in $\mathcal{V}^h$:
\begin{equation}
  F(w)[v] = a(w,v) - \ip{f}{v}.  \label{eq:residual}
\end{equation}
Finding $u^h$ is equivalent to making all components of its residual, that is
\begin{equation}
  F(u^h)[v]=0 \qquad \text{ if and only if } \qquad a(u^h,v)=\ip{f}{v} \label{eq:residualweakequivalence}
\end{equation}
for all $v$ in $\mathcal{V}^h$.

Given an iterate $w$ which does not already solve \eqref{eq:feweakpoisson}, we will update it using simple operations which make the residual components $F(w)[v]$ smaller.  To do this we will represent $w$ using the basis of hat functions, i.e.~$w = \sum w_q \psi_q$ with $w_q = w(x_q)$, and then compute a component in this basis using the linearity of $a(\cdot,\cdot)$:
\begin{equation}
  F(w)[\psi_p] = \sum_{q=1}^{m} a(\psi_q,\psi_p) \,w(x_q) - \ip{f}{\psi_p}.  \label{eq:residualpoisson}
\end{equation}
The number of nonzero terms in sum \eqref{eq:residualpoisson} is equal to the number of hat functions $\psi_q$ whose support overlaps the support of $\psi_p$.  This number is at most three in the current 1D case, and for general 2D and 3D meshes the number remains small (if the elements do not have small angles \cite{Braess2007}).  Thus the computation of a component $F(w)[\psi_p]$ requires $O(1)$ work, so computing all components of a residual linear functional $F(w)$ requires $O(m)$ work.  This observation about the cost of evaluating a residual is fundamental to all of our methods.

\subsection{Coarse mesh levels and subspace decompositions} \label{subsec:coarselevels}  From the above simple FE scheme we now take the first steps to build a \emph{multilevel} scheme.  Consider an enlarged set of hat functions:
    $$\underbrace{\psi_1(x),\dots,\psi_m(x)}_{\text{existing fine level}},\underbrace{\psi_{m+1}(x),\dots,\psi_M(x)}_{\text{\small coarser levels}}$$
For example, two coarser levels, derived from the fine level in Figure \ref{fig:finehats} by coarsening, are shown in Figure \ref{fig:coarsehats}.  The first coarsening (top) by-passes every other node on the fine mesh, and the next coarsening (bottom) does this again.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{genfigs/coarsehats.pdf}

\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{genfigs/coarsesthats.pdf}
\caption{Coarser levels amount to additional sets of hat functions which spread over a greater distance.}
\label{fig:coarsehats}
\end{figure}

On 2D and 3D meshes this manner of constructing coarse-mesh hats is less straightforward, and it is more common to start from a coarse mesh and refine level-by-level up to the finest.  In any case, our methods are not restricted to equally-spaced meshes, though models with high-resolution structured meshes \cite[for example]{Bueler2016,Winkelmannetal2011} are among our target applications.

We need notation for the levels.  Suppose that the coarsest level is indexed as $j=0$ and the finest as $j=J$, and that the hat functions $\psi_p^j(x)$, for $p=1,\dots,m_j$, form the $j$th level.  The interior nodes $x_p^j$ use the same multilevel indexing scheme.  Figures \ref{fig:finehats} and \ref{fig:coarsehats} show a three-level scheme ($J=2$) with $m_2=7$ fine-level, $m_1=3$ middle-level, and $m_0=1$ coarsest-level hat functions.  The original mesh has $m_2+1=8$ elements, divisible by four, so three-level coarsening was allowed.  Note that the original fine level has now gained a superscript $J$; the original hats are $\psi_p^J(x)$ and the original nodes are $x_p^J$.

On each level the hat functions are linearly-independent and form a basis for a vector space:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{V}^j = \operatorname{span}\{\psi_1^j(x),\dots,\psi_{m_j}^j(x)\} \subset \mathcal{H}.  \label{eq:definevk}
\end{equation}
These spaces are nested, i.e.~$\mathcal{V}^{j-1} \subset \mathcal{V}^j$, because each hat function can be written as a linear combination of finer-level hats,
\begin{equation}
   \psi_p^{j-1}(x) = \sum_{q=1}^{m_j} c_{pq} \psi_q^j(x). \label{eq:hatcombination}
\end{equation}
In fact, the coefficients are
\begin{equation}
  c_{pq} = \psi_p^{j-1}(x_q^j) \label{eq:nodalcoefficients}
\end{equation}
because $\{\psi_q^j\}$ form a nodal basis.  Nonzero coefficients $c_{pq}$ therefore occur only when a fine-level node $x_q^j$ is in the non-zero set (the open \emph{support}) of a coarser hat $\psi_p^{j-1}(x)$.  Statements \eqref{eq:hatcombination} and \eqref{eq:nodalcoefficients}, while simple, will be used throughout the paper when we need to pass between levels.

A \emph{multilevel subspace decomposition} is now described by the vector-space sum:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{V}^h = \mathcal{V}^0 + \mathcal{V}^1 + \dots + \mathcal{V}^J. \label{eq:subspacedecomposition}
\end{equation}
This decomposition will be useful despite the facts that the subspaces are nested.  In fact, the final term $\mathcal{V}^J$ is actually equal to the whole FE space $\mathcal{V}^h$.  Equation \eqref{eq:subspacedecomposition} asserts that a piecewise-linear function in $\mathcal{V}^h$ \emph{can} be written as a linear combination of hat functions from all the levels, but there is no unique representation.  A multilevel method will use this decomposition to find the components of the solution in $\mathcal{V}^h$ via fast computations on all levels $\mathcal{V}^j$.

Using our hat function bases, a subspace decomposition provides an approximate \emph{scale of frequencies} in the following informal sense.  The value of the inner product of a function $g(x)$ with a fine-level hat, $\ip{g}{\psi_p^J}$, is, relative to the norm $\|g\| = \ip{g}{g}^{1/2}$, mostly a measure of its high-frequency content at $x_p^J$.  The inner product with a coarser-mesh hat $\psi_p^j$, by contrast, measures lower frequency content because it averages over many fine-mesh nodes.  If decomposition \eqref{eq:subspacedecomposition} were instead a Fourier decomposition, with each $\mathcal{V}^j$ spanned by waves of disjoint frequency ranges, then the sum would be orthogonal and the ``scale of frequencies'' meaning would be exact.  Our decompositions will always involve overlapping and nonorthogonal ranges of frequencies, but multilevel methods will reduce the energy of the high frequencies in the error on each level $\mathcal{V}^j$.  Doing this on all levels will rapidly reduce the whole error.

\subsection{Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, and explicit time-stepping as smoothers} \label{subsec:smoothers}  Our first solution method for FE problem \eqref{eq:feweakpoisson}, called \emph{Gauss-Seidel} (GS) iteration, is sequential and point-wise \emph{relaxation} of the residual \eqref{eq:residual}.  Though matrices are often used to present this classical iteration algorithms \cite[for example]{Bueler2021,Greenbaum1997}, we present it using only residuals and hat functions/  The same approach will be beneficial when we consider nonlinear glacier models.

The GS algorithm on the $j$th level sweeps through the mesh nodes $x_p^j$, modifying the iterate $w(x)$ by a multiple of $\psi_p^j$ to make that residual value zero.  That is, at each node we compute $c$ so that
\begin{equation}
  F(w+c\,\psi_p^j)[\psi_p^j] = 0.  \label{eq:gaussseidelpoint}
\end{equation}
Observe that $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ is bilinear and thus that $F(w+c\,\psi_p^j)[\psi_p^j] = F(w)[\psi_p^j] + c\, a(\psi_p^j,\psi_p^j)$.  Define $\ell[v] = \ip{f}{v}$, a linear functional.  In these terms, GS is the following algorithm which modifies $w$ in place:
\begin{pseudo*} \label{ps:gs-sweep}
\pr{gs-sweep}(j,w,a,\ell,\id{omega}=1)\text{:} \\+
    $F(w)[\cdot] := a(w,\cdot) - \ell[\cdot]$ \\
    for $p=1,\dots,m_j$ \\+
        $\displaystyle c = - F(w)[\psi_p^j]\, \big/ \,a(\psi_p^j,\psi_p^j)$  \\
        $w \gets w + \id{omega} \,c \,\psi_p^j$
\end{pseudo*}
So that such methods will generalize, we regard the bilinear form $a$ and the linear functional $\ell$ as inputs, and build the residual when needed.

Assuming that value $a(\psi_p^j,\psi_q^j)$ and $\ell[\psi_p^j] = \ip{f}{\psi_p^j}$ are computed in $O(1)$ work, one application of \pr{gs-sweep} requires $O(m_j)$ work.  Though \pr{gs-sweep} only works as stated for a linear equation in the form of \eqref{eq:feweakpoisson}, it can be modified to solve nonlinear systems by applying a few steps of Newton's iteration to each scalar equation $f(c) = F(w+c\,\psi_p^j)[\psi_p^j] = 0$; see section \ref{sec:sia}.

What does a sweep of GS do to an iterate $w$?  By sequentially making the residual zero on each hat function we intend that the residual becomes smaller.  However, modifying $w$ to make the residual zero at one place means that previously-zeroed locations are no longer zero because the equations are non-trivially coupled.  Nonetheless one can prove for the Poisson problem that this iteration, applied soley on the fine level, converges to the solution $u^h$ of \eqref{eq:feweakpoisson} \cite[for example]{Greenbaum1997}, but that is not our focus.  Instead, a key observation is that such a sweep is a fast \emph{smoother} of the (algebraic) error $e=w-u^h$, even when it is slow to make the whole error small.

Informally, the formula for $c$ in \textsc{gs-sweep} combines neighboring values of $w$ so as to flatten a peak or trough in the error.  An example is shown in Figure \ref{fig:residualpoints}, where we start with a non-smooth initial iterate $w$ on an $m_J=6$ mesh; its residual $F(w)$ and error $e$ are at the top.  The Figure shows the residual and error after each step in the \textbf{for} loop in \pr{gs-sweep}, indicating the location which is zeroed.  (We plot the linear functionals $F(w)$ as piecewise-constant functions with values $F(w)[\psi_p^J]$.)  While both the residual and error become smaller in norm, the strongest effect is the damping of high frequencies.

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{genfigs/residualpoints.pdf}
\caption{One Gauss-Seidel (GS) sweep on the fine level adjusts the iterate $w$ so that the residual $F(w)[\psi_p^J]$ at each successive node $x_p^J$ is zero (left).  The corresponding errors $e=w-u^h$ get significantly smoother (right).}
\label{fig:residualpoints}
\end{figure}

One may describe the smoothing property of GS quantitatively by considering the frequencies which are supported on a mesh having spacing $h$.  The highest-frequency faithfully-represented mode is the sawtooth with (spatial) frequency $\sigma=(2h)^{-1}$.  For a 1D Poisson equation, with one GS sweep multiplies all modes with frequencies higher than $\frac{1}{2} \sigma$ by factors of at most $1/\sqrt{5}\approx 0.45$ (for sufficiently-fine meshes \cite[Chapter 4]{Briggsetal2000}).  That is, a GS sweep \emph{strongly damps the highest half} of the frequencies in the error.  Note that the particular damping factor depends on the dimension and the differential operator.

One may also adjust the \emph{relaxation factor} \id{omega} in \pr{gs-sweep} away from its default value \id{omega} $=1$, which yields \emph{successive over-relaxation} for \id{omega} $>1$.  This iteration has superior properties as a stand-alone solver \cite{Greenbaum1997}, but it is no better than GS as a smoother.

Algorithm \pr{gs-sweep} has no dependence on the dimension of the problem.  In particular, for any linear elliptic PDE which can be written in weak form \eqref{eq:weakpoisson}, \pr{gs-sweep} applies as stated with $m_j$ denoting the number of $j$th-level mesh nodes and $\psi_p^j$ the corresponding hat functions.  However, the rate of convergence and the smoothing efficiency of GS iterations depend on the details of the PDE, including its dimension.

Note that GS involves repeatedly re-evaluating the pointwise residual, i.e.~computing $F(w)[\psi_p^j]$ after each update of $w$.  Where each evaluation of a point residual is expensive, for instance when a residual evaluation is non-local (see section \ref{sec:stokes}), an alternative is to evaluate the residual vector (i.e.~at all points) once at the start of the iteration.  The resulting \emph{(weighted) Jacobi} method is parallel in the sense that pointwise updates can then be done in any order.

\begin{pseudo*} \label{ps:jacobi-sweep}
\pr{jacobi-sweep}(j,w,a,\ell,\id{omega}=0.67)\text{:} \\+
    $F_p = a(w,\psi_p^j) - \ell[\psi_p^j]$ \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \ct{for all $p$} \\
    for $p=1,\dots,m_j$ \\+
        $\displaystyle c = - F_p \, \big/ \, a(\psi_p^j,\psi_p^j)$  \\
        $w \gets w + \id{omega} \,c \,\psi_p^j$
\end{pseudo*}

The Jacobi iteration with relaxation factor \id{omega} $=1$ is neither a rapid solution method nor an effective smoother---no damping is applied to the highest-frequency sawtooth---but underrelaxation can be a good smoother.  For a 1D Poisson equation and optimal factor \id{omega} $=\frac{2}{3}$, the method multiplies all frequencies higher than $\frac{1}{2} \sigma$ by at most $\frac{1}{3}$ \cite[Chapter 4]{Briggsetal2000}.  Other optimal factors are known for 2D and 3D Poisson equation, and to varying degrees this good smoother performance extends to other PDEs.

These smoother considerations seem to be separate from how evolving-geometry glacier models have been designed in the past.  Most ice sheet models proceed by explicit time-stepping of their complicated, coupled equations \cite[for example]{Winkelmannetal2011}.  However, it turns out that such time-stepping is closely related to Jacobi smoothing.  Consider the time-dependent problem corresponding to the $\alpha=1$ case of \eqref{eq:poisson}, namely the \emph{heat equation}
\begin{equation}
u_t = u_{xx} + f, \qquad u(t,0)=u(t,1)=0, \label{eq:heat}
\end{equation}
for $u(t,x)$ and $t>0$, and subject to some initial condition $u(0,x)=g(x)$.  The corresponding FEM weak form follows (as usual) by multiplying by $v$ from $\mathcal{V}^j$ \cite[Chapter 8]{Johnson2009},
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt}\ip{u^h}{v} = -a(u^h,v) + \ip{f}{v} = - F(u^h)[v], \label{eq:feheat}
\end{equation}
with $F$ given by \eqref{eq:residual} as before.  Expanding the FEM solution $u^h(t,x)$ in hat functions, we have
\begin{equation}
u^h(t,x) = \sum_{q=1}^{m_j} u^h(t,x_p^j) \psi_p^j(x). \label{eq:trialheat}
\end{equation}
Equation \eqref{eq:feheat} with $v=\psi_p^j$ generates an ODE system for the coefficients:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{q=1}^{m_j} \ip{\psi_p^j}{\psi_q^j} u^h(t,x_p^j) = - F(u^h)[\psi_p^j] \label{eq:odeheatearly}
\end{equation}
Identifying the \emph{mass matrix} $B$ with entries $b_{pq} = \ip{\psi_p^j}{\psi_q^j}$, which is an easily inverted matrix with $O(1)$ condition number \cite{Elmanetal2014}, we can write the ODE system as
\begin{equation}
u^h(t,x_p^j)' = - (B^{-1} F(u^h)[\cdot])_p. \label{eq:odeheat}
\end{equation}

Suppose we discretize time using spacing $\Delta t$ and then we approximate the consecutive states $u^h(t,x)$, $u^h(t+\Delta t,x)$ by $w(x)$, $\tilde w(x)$, respectively.  Then, using the forward Euler method, \eqref{eq:odeheat} becomes
\begin{equation}
\frac{\tilde w_p - w_p}{\Delta t} = - (B^{-1} F(w)[\cdot])_p. \label{eq:forwardeulerheat}
\end{equation}
Let us write this time-step as a pseudocode which takes the current values $w$ and computes the new values $\tilde w$.  Up to the inversion of the mass matrix $B$, and choosing to compute the updated iterate in-place, this is the same method as \pr{jacobi-sweep}:
\begin{pseudo*} \label{ps:euler-timestep}
\pr{euler-timestep}(j,w,a,\ell,\id{deltat})\text{:} \\+
    $F_p = a(w,\psi_p^j) - \ell[\psi_p^j]$ \\
    for $p=1,\dots,m_j$ \\+
        $\displaystyle c = - (B^{-1} F)_p$  \\
        $w \gets w + \id{deltat}\, c\, \psi_p^j$ \\-
\end{pseudo*}
In particular, the time step \id{deltat} plays the role of \id{omega} in \pr{jacobi-sweep}.  However, the change $c$ to the value $w_p$ is not divided by the diagonal entries $a(\psi_p^j,\psi_p^j)$, as in the Jacobi iteration, so for \emph{conditional stability} \cite{Bueler2021} one must choose \id{deltat} $=O(h^2)$.

In summary, the GS and Jacobi iterations act as smoothers when applied to the Poisson problem \eqref{eq:poisson}.  Subject to severe stability restrictions on the time step, forward Euler time-stepping for the corresponding heat equation \eqref{eq:heat} is also a smoother.  Applied on a single mesh level, these methods are all slow to converge.  Optimal solver performance therefore depends on applying such smoothers on different mesh levels.

\subsection{Multilevel subspace corrections} \label{subsec:msc}  When a smoother is applied on a given level $j$, whether once or a few times, the error and residual of the iterate no longer contain much energy in high-frequency modes.  It makes sense to switch to smoothing on the $j-1$ level to remove energy in lower frequencies.  That is, we correct the residual on the next-coarser level.

For example, if we start on the finest level $J$ then we have the following \emph{multilevel subspace corrections} \cite{Xu1992} algorithm:
\begin{pseudo*} \label{ps:msc-downslash}
\pr{msc-downslash}(w,a,\ell)\text{:} \\+
    for $j=J$ downto $0$ \\+
        \pr{smoother}(j,w,a,\ell)
\end{pseudo*}
Here \pr{smoother} stands for \pr{gs-sweep}, \pr{jacobi-sweep}, or even \pr{euler-timestep}.  The reason this downward-only scheme is called ``slash'' is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:msccycles}.

In fact, one can remove lowest error frequencies first by initially computing corrections on the coarsest level:
\begin{pseudo*} \label{ps:msc-upslash}
\pr{msc-upslash}(w,a,\ell)\text{:} \\+
    for $j=0$ to $J$ \\+
        \pr{smoother}(j,w,a,\ell)
\end{pseudo*}
Alternatively, the two slashes can be combined into a ``V'' cycle:
\begin{pseudo*} \label{ps:msc-vcycle}
\pr{msc-vcycle}(w,a,\ell)\text{:} \\+
    for $j=J$ downto $0$ \\+
        \pr{smoother}(j,w,a,\ell) \\-
    for $j=1$ to $J$ \\+
        \pr{smoother}(j,w,a,\ell)
\end{pseudo*}
Furthermore one may repeat the smoother on each level, or go up-and-down the mesh hierarchy in a more complicated manner (``W-cycles'', for example); there are many possibilities \cite{Briggsetal2000,Trottenbergetal2001}.

\begin{figure}
\input{tikz/msccycles.tex}
\caption{Subspace corrections may be applied in different orders: \pr{msc-downslash} (left),  \pr{msc-upslash} (middle), or \pr{msc-vcycle} (right).  Each dot in this three-level hierarchy ($J=2$) is a smoother application.}
\label{fig:msccycles}
\end{figure}

These MSC cycles improve a fine-level iterate $w^J$ but they do not (generally) exactly solve problem \eqref{eq:feweakpoisson}.  Instead one should apply them iteratively, testing for convergence using a tolerance on the norm of the fine-level residual.  (An alternative view of MSC algorithms would treat them as preconditioners \cite{Bueler2021}, but we will not need this view.)  For example, one may require the residual to decrease from its initial value by a certain factor:
\begin{pseudo*} \label{ps:msc-solver}
\pr{msc-solver}(w^J,a,\ell,\id{rtol}=10^{-4})\text{:} \\+
    $F_p = a(w^J,\psi_p^J) - \ell[\psi_p^J]$ \\
    $r_0 = \|F\|$ \\
    repeat \\+
        \pr{msc-cycle}(w,a,\ell) \qquad\qquad \ct{\pr{cycle}=\pr{downslash}$|$\pr{upslash}$|$\pr{vcycle}} \\
        $F_p = a(w^J,\psi_p^J) - \ell[\psi_p^J]$ \\-
    until $\|F\| \le r_0\, \id{rtol}$ \\
    return $w^J$
\end{pseudo*}
Note that the user needs to provide an initial iterate $w^J$ on the fine level.

Such simply-stated MSC schemes appeared late in the history of multigrid \cite{Xu1992}, but they contain the core multigrid ideas and consequent performance.  The following theorem applies to linear elliptic PDEs in any dimension, if defined by a symmetric and positive bilinear form.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:mscconvergence}  Let $u^h$ be the exact solution of FE weak form \eqref{eq:feweakpoisson}.  Suppose $w^{(s)}$ is computed by from $s$ applications of \pr{msc-downslash}, \pr{msc-upslash}, or \pr{msc-vcycle} on the fine ($J$th) level, starting with any $w^{(0)}$.  There is $\rho<1$, independent of $h$, so that
\begin{equation}
  \|w^{(s+1)} - u^h\|_{\mathcal{H}} \le \rho \|w^{(s)} - u^h\|_{\mathcal{H}}.  \label{eq:mscconvergence}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

Each cycle therefore reduces the error by a mesh-independent factor $\rho<1$, called the \emph{multigrid convergence rate} \cite{Braess2007}.  The proof, by \cite{Neuss1998}, extends an earlier Jacobi smoothing result \cite{BraessHackbusch1983} to include GS smoothing; see also \cite[Thm.~3.10]{GraeserKornhuber2009}.  The convergence rate $\rho$ does not depend on the fine-mesh spacing $h$, nor on the number of fine-mesh degrees of freedom $m_J$, nor even the number of levels $J$.  It does depend on the element aspect ratios (\emph{shape regularity} \cite{Elmanetal2014}) in the mesh, though this is not relevant in 1D, and on the \emph{ellipticity bound} $\alpha_0=\inf_x \alpha(x)$ of the PDE.  It is common for a V-cycle to have a smaller $\rho$ than a slash cycle, but the latter do less work per cycle, so in section \ref{sec:obstacle}, when we present computational results, we will count computational work and run time, and not just cycles.

It follows from \eqref{eq:mscconvergence} that if we want the error norm $e^{(s)} = \|w^{(s)}-u^h\|_{\mathcal{H}}$ to be reduced to below some small level $\eps>0$ then we should do $s>(\log\eps - \log e^{(0)})/\log \rho$ iterations.  That is, we need $s=O(|\log\eps|)$ iterations.  (Note that $h$ and $J$ are related by logarithms; in our case $h=(m_J+1)^{-1}=2^{-(J+1)}$ so $J = O(\log m_J) = O(|\log h|)$.)  On the other hand, the error norms in \eqref{eq:mscconvergence} are not generally computable.  An error norm is, however, bounded by the computable residual norm up to a (mesh-dependent) matrix condition number \cite[Chapter 2]{Bueler2016}.

The pseudocode \pr{msc-solver} does not, yet, define an efficiently-implementable solver.  Its performance depends on how iterates $w$ and residuals $F=F(w)$ are \emph{represented on each mesh level}.  For example, if we represent $w$ and $F$ using the fine-level basis $\{\psi_p^J\}$ then one application of \pr{gs-sweep} is indeed fast, i.e.~$O(m_J)$ operations, with a small constant, because evaluating each $F(w)[\psi_p^J]$ requires only a few operations.  However, evaluating $F(w)[\psi_p^j]$ on coarse levels ($j<J$) means computing integrals over the wide support of $\psi_p^j$, which is nonzero at many fine-mesh nodes $x_p^J$.  For example, \pr{gs-sweep} on a coarser level $j<J$ is not an efficient operation if $w$ and $F$ are represented on the fine level; it is not an $O(m_j)$ operation with a coefficient which is independent of $j$.  This important concern is addressed via hierarchical representations, which are compatible with our multilevel corrections.

\subsection{Linear geometric multigrid} \label{subsec:gmg}  Once the smoother has been applied on the fine level, so that the error and the residual no longer contain much energy in the high-frequency modes, the smoother should then be applied on the next-coarser level.  However, a fast algorithm must use appropriate coarse-level data structures to represent the problem on the new level.  When this idea is applied down the mesh-level hierarchy, we go beyond multilevel subspace corrections and create a true multigrid algorithm.

Efficiency on coarser levels requires addressing two related concerns:
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\emph{\roman{enumi})}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item How do we represent an iterate $w$ and a residual $F(w)$ on the $j$th level?
\item How does a $j$th-level problem descend to the representation on the $j-1$ level?
\end{enumerate}

Our answer to \emph{i)} is straightforward.  A function $w(x) = \sum_p w_p \psi_p^j(x)$ in $\mathcal{V}^j$ is represented by its nodal values $w_p=w(x_p^j)$, thus $\bw = \{w_p\}$ is a vector in $\RR^{m_j}$.  Representing a residual $F(w)$, a linear functional in $(\mathcal{V}^j)'$, is just as simple because the values $F_p = F(w)[\psi_p^j]$ form a vector $\bF=\{F_p\}$, also in $\RR^{m_j}$.  It is common to think of $\bw$ as a column vector and $\bF$ as a row vector, but this is not essential.

For \emph{ii)} we must derive a new equation for the coarser level, one which loses only minimal information when the key quantities are smooth.\footnote{The equation, standard in multgrid literature, is only novel relative to our story so far.}  Note that for an iterate $w$ in the FE space $\mathcal{V}^h$, the residual definition \eqref{eq:residual} can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
  a(w,v) = \ell[v] + F(w)[v],  \label{eq:residualrewrite}
\end{equation}
recalling $\ell[v] = \ip{f}{v}$.  Subtracting the weak form \eqref{eq:feweakpoisson} from \eqref{eq:residualrewrite} cancels the source term:
\begin{equation}
  a(w,v) - a(u^h,v) = F(w)[v].  \label{eq:errorequationearly}
\end{equation}
Because of the linearity of $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ in the first position, we have the (weak-form) \emph{error equation},
\begin{equation}
  a(e,v) = F(w)[v],  \label{eq:errorequation}
\end{equation}
for all $v$ in $\mathcal{V}^h$, where $e=w-u^h$ is the algebraic error.

Regarded as applying in $\mathcal{V}^h$, error equation \eqref{eq:errorequation} is equivalent to the original FE weak form \eqref{eq:feweakpoisson}; it is not new.  (Just reverse the above derivation.)  However, if the smoother has already been applied to an iterate $w$ then both $e$ and the residual $F(w)$ are smoothed quantities.  That is, both sides of \eqref{eq:errorequation} should have accurate representations in terms of the coarser hats $\{\psi_p^{J-1}\}$, without using all of the fine-level hats $\{\psi_p^{J}\}$.

Multigrid therefore approximates \eqref{eq:errorequation} with a \emph{coarse-level equation} in which all quantities are represented using the coarser-level basis.  To state it we generalize to an arbitrary level $j>0$ and suppose $w^j$ is any iterate in $\mathcal{V}^j$.  Then \eqref{eq:errorequation} is approximated on the $j-1$ level as follows:
\begin{equation}
  a(e^{j-1},v) = (R\ell^j)[v] \qquad \text{where} \qquad \ell^j = F^j(w^j),  \label{eq:coarsecorrection}
\end{equation}
for all $v$ in $\mathcal{V}^{j-1}$.  Note $F^j(w^j)$ is the residual from the $j$th-level equation, and on the finest level $F^J(w^J)[v] = F(w^J)[v] = a(w^J,v) - \ip{f}{v}$.  Again, we will represent $e^{j-1}$ in the basis $\{\psi_p^{j-1}\}$, and $R\ell^j$  in $(\mathcal{V}^{j-1})'$ by its values $(R\ell^j)[\psi_p^{j-1}]$.

In \eqref{eq:coarsecorrection} we have used the \emph{canonical restriction operator} $R$ to transfer the residual.  By definition, $R$ maps a linear functional $\ell$ in $(\mathcal{V}^j)'$ to a linear functional in $(\mathcal{V}^{j-1})'$:
\begin{equation}
  (R \ell)[v] = \ell[v], \label{eq:canonicalrestriction}
\end{equation}
for all $v$ in $\mathcal{V}^{j-1}$.  That is, $R \ell$ acts on $\mathcal{V}^{j-1}$ in the same manner as $\ell$, but we will \emph{represent} $R\ell$ by its $j-1$ level values.  From \eqref{eq:hatcombination} and \eqref{eq:nodalcoefficients},
\begin{equation}
  (R \ell)[\psi_p^{j-1}] = \sum_{q=1}^{m_j} c_{pq}\, \ell[\psi_q^j], \label{eq:canonicalrestrictionaction}
\end{equation}
with $c_{pq}=\psi_p^{j-1}(x_q^j)$.  Note that this \emph{full-weighting} formula \cite{Briggsetal2000} requires some computation.

Once the solution $e^{j-1}$ of \eqref{eq:coarsecorrection} is found, the update
\begin{equation}
  w^j \gets w^j + P e^{j-1}  \label{eq:update}
\end{equation}
``corrects'' the fine-level iterate.  This requires yet another map, the \emph{canonical prolongation} $P$, which acts on a function $y$ in $\mathcal{V}^{j-1}$ to give $Py$ in $\mathcal{V}^j$:
\begin{equation}
  (P y)(x) = y(x). \label{eq:canonicalprolongation}
\end{equation}
Again \eqref{eq:hatcombination} and \eqref{eq:nodalcoefficients} are used to find the components of $Py$ in the fine-level basis; if $y=\sum_p y_p \psi_p^{j-1}$ then $Py = \sum_q (Py)_q \psi_q^j$ where
\begin{equation}
  (Py)_q = \sum_{p=1}^{m_{j-1}} c_{pq}\, y_p, \label{eq:canonicalprolongationaction}
\end{equation}
and $c_{pq} = \psi_p^{j-1}(x_q^j)$ as before.  While no information is lost because $\mathcal{V}^{j-1} \subset \mathcal{V}^j$, and indeed the result $P y$ is the same piecewise-linear function as the input $y$, the representation has changed.

Combining the above ideas with the earlier MSC cycles gives an efficiently-implementable \emph{geometric multigrid} (GMG) method.  We show a V-cycle, but this includes the slash cycles just by setting parameters.  In addition to sweeps of the GS smoother, it solves the coarse-level correction equation \eqref{eq:coarsecorrection}, applies update \eqref{eq:update}, and follows by more smoother sweeps (Figure \ref{fig:vcycle}).  The following pseudocode modifies the fine-level iterate $w$ in-place, and it can be called repeatedly so as to improve the iterate.
\begin{pseudo*} \label{ps:gmg-vcycle}

\begin{figure}
\input{tikz/vcycle.tex}
\caption{A four-level V-cycle with distinguished methods: down-smoother (solid dots), up-smoother (circles), and coarse-level solver (square).}
\label{fig:vcycle}
\end{figure}

To summarize this fundamental algorithm (Figure \ref{fig:vcycle}), after ``down-smoother'' sweeps, here denoted $\text{\textsc{smoother}}^{\text{\texttt{down}}}$, the correction equation \eqref{eq:coarsecorrection} is applied on the next-coarser level with a ``new'' source (linear functional) $\ell^{j-1}$, and a zero initial iterate.  Observe that $\ell^{j-1}$ is the amount by which the finer-level iterate $w^j$ did not already solve the problem; for example, if $w^J=u^h$ then $\ell^{J-1}=0$.  After the correction additional ``up-smoother'' sweeps are done to remove high-frequency components from the updated iterate.  Note that memory is needed to hold the states $w^0,\dots,w^J$ (i.e.~until after all coarse-level corrections).  It is also common to implement \pr{gmg-vcycle} recursively.

The default settings give a V-cycle, denoted V(1,1).  If \id{up} $=0$ we get a V(1,0) down-slash cycle and \id{down} $=0$ gives a V(0,1) up-slash (Figure \ref{fig:msccycles}).

The algorithm calls a solver subroutine on the coarsest $j=0$ level.  This may be a direct solver for a linear problem, but they are not available for our nonlinear glacier problems.  For simplicity and generalizability we suppose \pr{gmg-coarsesolve} is also implemented as a fixed number of in-place smoother sweeps:
\begin{pseudo*} \label{ps:gmg-coarsesolve}
\pr{gmg-coarsesolve}(w,a,\ell,\id{coarse}=1)\text{:} \\+
    $\text{\pr{smoother}}^{\text{\id{coarse}}}(0,w,a,\ell)$ \\
\end{pseudo*}
If the coarsest mesh has a single node ($m_0=1$) then, for a linear problem, a single sweep exactly solves the $j=0$ problem.  In general, an accurate solution is fast if $m_0$ is small, but the choice of a coarse-level mesh and solver is nontrivial for realistic problems (sections \ref{sec:sia} and \ref{sec:stokes}).

Before proceeding, the reader might ask what makes the above V-cycles ``geometric''?  Though the label is partly historical, note that our restriction and prolongation operators arise from the dimensions of the FE mesh via coefficients which use the hat functions ($c_{pq} = \psi_p^{j-1}(x_q^j)$).  Also, we \emph{rediscretize} on coarser levels, that is, we use the original bilinear form $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ on all levels.  An alternative to rediscretization is the \emph{Galerkin} approach which forms coarser-level matrices recursively by $A^{j-1} = R A^j P$, starting from $A^J$ which is the fine-level system matrix; see \cite[Chapter V]{Braess2007} and \cite[Chapter 6]{Bueler2021}.  Going further away from our approach, in a \emph{algebraic multigrid} (AMG) method \cite[Appendix A]{Trottenbergetal2001} the prolongation $P$ is constructed using operations on the entries of $A^J$, and such algorithms invariably define $R=P^\top$.  On linear elliptic problems the geometric and algebraic approaches are closely-related, in part because AMG has been ``tuned'' to generate prolongations $P$ with similar coefficients, but for our upcoming nonlinear and inequality-constrained problems the geometric approach generalizes directly.  By contrast, AMG can only solve the linear steps in a separately-constructed iteration, e.g.~by requiring an outer Newton iteration.  GMG and AMG approaches are natural competitors for the highest-performance solutions, but we will persevere here with the geometric approach.

\subsection{On transfer operators} \label{subsec:transfers}  The operators $R$ and $P$ make no choices, which is the meaning of ``canonical''.  However, their application requires computation because of how we represent functions and functionals on each level.  In fact, full-weighting formulae \eqref{eq:canonicalrestrictionaction} and \eqref{eq:canonicalprolongationaction}, which generalize verbatim to unstructured 2D and 3D meshes when the indices $p,q$ denote the nodes of the mesh \cite[Chapter V]{Braess2007}, arise from the simple fact \eqref{eq:hatcombination}, that each coarse-level hat function is a linear combination of fine-level hats.

As linear operators, $R$ and $P$ may be represented as sparse, rectangular matrices, and they are transposes ($P=R^\top$), but using memory to store them this way is unnecessary.  They are applied in $O(m_j)$ operations via \eqref{eq:canonicalrestrictionaction} and \eqref{eq:canonicalprolongationaction}.  However, the two operators differ in their invertibility.  The one-to-one map $P$ has a left inverse; function $y$ in $\mathcal{V}^{j-1}$ can be exactly recovered from $Py$ because they are the same piecewise-linear function.  In fact, we will only make $P$ explicit to indicate a change in vector representation.  By contrast, $\ell$ in $(\mathcal{V}^j)'$ is not recoverable from $R\ell$ because the values $\ell[\psi_q^j]$, i.e.~the action of $\ell$ on the finer level hats, are averaged onto the coarse level, and thus lost.

It turns out that five such mesh-level \emph{transfer} operators are used in this paper, two of which are not even linear.  See Table \ref{tab:transfers}.  Note they can all be applied in $O(m_j)$ time.

We have now presented a basic GMG algorithm for linear PDEs via a particular FE viewpoint, namely the MSC approach pioneered by Xu \cite{Xu1992} and others.  The MSC viewpoint is foundational for multilevel, domain-decomposition, and other advanced algorithms \cite[for example]{Farrelletal2019}.  Our next step might be to show computational results demonstrating the efficiency of a GMG algorithm, giving evidence of optimal $O(m_J)$ time to solve the problem, and indeed such results appear in all of our multigrid references \cite{Braess2007,Briggsetal2000,Bueler2021,Elmanetal2014,Trottenbergetal2001}.  However, we first introduce a less-standard ``obstacle'' problem because it shows the essential free-boundary character of the glacier geometry problem.  Computational results appear in each of the next three sections.


\section{Multilevel constraint decomposition (MCD) for the classical obstacle problem} \label{sec:obstacle}

\subsection{An ice-like model problem} \label{subsec:obstacleproblem}  We now have a clear view of the GMG method, for a linear equation and from the MSC point of view.  However, as addressed in section \ref{sec:intro}, the main problem of how glacier geometry and ice velocity co-evolve in response to climatic inputs requires an inequality constraint for well-posedness.  The fact that the ice surface elevation is above the bed generates the land-terminating mass-conservation boundary condition.  This constraint, by itself, makes the problem nonlinear and reduces solution regularity, making it challenging to numerical methods.

To address such constraints in a multilevel framework, and before actually modeling glaciers in section \ref{sec:sia}, we introduce the \emph{classical obstacle problem}.  It simply adds an inequality constraint to linear Poisson equation \eqref{eq:poisson}.  After stating the weak form, which is now solved over a convex \emph{subset} of the function space, we will modify the MSC approach into the \emph{multilevel constraint decomposition} (MCD) method.  Each mesh level will host an inequality-constrained problem, and together all the levels will capture the constraint subset.  The nonlinear SIA model (section \ref{sec:sia}) and the Stokes model (section \ref{sec:stokes}) will use a nonlinear extension of the MCD method.

Consider the same 1D domain and solution space $\mathcal{H}=H_0^1[0,1]$ as before.  Let $\varphi(x)$ be a fixed function, the obstacle, from $\mathcal{H}$.  The strong form of the classical obstacle problem is the following \emph{complementarity problem} (CP) \cite{Bueler2021,KinderlehrerStampacchia1980} which says that the solution $u(x)$ is above $\varphi(x)$ \emph{and} that a differential equation applies whereever $u$ is strictly above $\varphi$:
\begin{align}
  u - \varphi &\ge 0 \label{eq:obstaclecp} \\
  -(\alpha u')'-f &\ge 0 \notag \\
  (u-\varphi)(-(\alpha u')'-f) &= 0 \notag
\end{align}
The third condition, \emph{complementarity} itself, implies that for each $x$ in $[0,1]$ the solution either coincides with the obstacle ($u(x)=\varphi(x)$) or PDE \eqref{eq:poisson} holds.  (Both facts can hold at $x$, but in the generic \emph{nondegenerate} \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980} case the obstacle does not itself solve the PDE.)

In the $u=\varphi$ region the constraint is said to be \emph{active}, while \eqref{eq:poisson} holds in the \emph{inactive} portion where $u>\varphi$.  One refers to PDE \eqref{eq:poisson} as the \emph{interior condition} of the CP \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}.  Note that in the active region the source term is bounded above, $u=\varphi \implies f \le -(\alpha\varphi')'$, but the corresponding statement does \emph{not} hold for the glacier problems in sections \ref{sec:sia} and \ref{sec:stokes}.

Simply by choosing a source term $f(x)$ which is positive in the middle of the domain and negative near the boundaries, we create an ``ice-like'' solution to \eqref{eq:obstaclecp}.  For example, Figure \ref{fig:icelike} (top) shows the exact, piecewise-quadratic solution $u(x)$ for the following data:
\begin{equation}
\varphi(x) = x(1-x), \quad \alpha(x)=1, \quad f(x) = \begin{cases} 8, & 0.2 < x < 0.8, \\
                                                                 -16, & x<0.2 \text{ or } x>0.8. \end{cases}  \label{eq:icelikedetails}
\end{equation}
(Note that $f$ is in $L^2[0,1]$ and is defined almost everywhere.)  Finding the exact formula for $u(x)$, which smoothly-connects five quadratic pieces, is an exercise for the reader.\footnote{Solution in\, \href{https://github.com/bueler/mg-glaciers/blob/master/py/obstacle.py}{\texttt{github.com/bueler/mg-glaciers/blob/master/py/obstacle.py}}.}  The bottom Figure shows a more typical solution for illustrating obstacle problems \cite[for example]{Bueler2021,Tai2003}.

\end{figure}

Unlike problem \eqref{eq:poisson}, the solution to \eqref{eq:obstaclecp} does \emph{not} depend linearly on the source function $f$.  For example, if $f \le 0$ and the obstacle is concave-down ($\varphi'' \le 0$) then the solution is $u=\varphi$.  (By the maximum principle \cite{Evans2010} there are no inactive points in this case.)  In such a case, if $\tilde u$ solves the problem for $\tilde f$ then $2\tilde u$ does not solve the problem for source term $2\tilde f$.  In this sense the classical obstacle problem is nonlinear even though its interior condition PDE is linear.

The glacier problem also has a CP formulation (section \ref{sec:sia}; see also \cite{Calvoetal2002}) in which the obstacle is the bed elevation, the solution is the glacier surface elevation, and the source term is the surface mass balance.  In the inactive region, i.e.~on the glacier, the mass conservation equation applies, and the surface mass balance must be negative in the active region off the glacier.

\subsection{Weak formulation with constraints} \label{subsec:obstacleweak}  We now define a closed subset which incorporates the constraint:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{K}_\varphi = \left\{v \ge \varphi\right\} \subseteq \mathcal{H}.  \label{eq:Kdefine}
\end{equation}
If $v$ is in $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$ then we say $v$ is \emph{admissible}.  Note $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$ is not a vector space, but it is \emph{convex}, that is, if $v,w$ are in $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$ then any point on the line segment connecting them, $\theta v + (1-\theta) w$ for $0 \le \theta \le 1$, is also in $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$.  One should also observe that $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$ is a \emph{cone} with vertex at $\varphi$.  That is, if $v$ is in $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$ then $\lambda(v-\varphi) + \varphi$ is also in $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$ for any $\lambda \ge 0$; the ray from $\varphi$ through $v$ is in $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$.

Derivation of the weak form involves multiplying the strong form \eqref{eq:obstaclecp} by a test function and integrating by parts.  The inequalities enter into the derivation; see \cite[Chapter 12]{Bueler2021}, \cite{JouvetBueler2012}, or \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980} for details.  The result is a single \emph{variational inequality} (VI),
\begin{equation}
  a(u,v-u) \ge \ip{f}{v-u} \quad \text{ for all } v \text{ in } \mathcal{K}_\varphi, \label{eq:obstaclevi}
\end{equation}
using the same bilinear form $a$ defined in \eqref{eq:weakpoissonearly}.  Recalling \eqref{eq:residual}, the VI can be restated using the residual functional:
\begin{equation}
  F(u)[v-u] \ge 0 \quad \text{ for all } v \text{ in } \mathcal{K}_\varphi. \label{eq:obstacleviresidual}
\end{equation}

Formulations \eqref{eq:obstaclecp} and \eqref{eq:obstacleviresidual} are equivalent up to the same regularity concerns which relate the strong and weak forms of a PDE.  (See reference \cite{Evans2010} regarding the solution regularity of PDEs, and \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980} for the corresponding VI theory.)  However, some intuition for VIs is needed for understanding the current paper, and so, in an attempt to help, we provide a second weak form.

Inequality \eqref{eq:obstacleviresidual} is equivalent to \emph{constrained minimization} of an \emph{objective} functional $I$:
\newcommand{\argmin}{\mathop{\mathrm{arg\text{-}min}}}
\begin{equation}
  u = \argmin_{w \text{ in } \mathcal{K}_\varphi} I(w) \quad \text{where} \quad I(w) = \frac{1}{2} a(w,w) - \ip{f}{w}. \label{eq:obstaclemin}
\end{equation}
That is, $u$ is the minimizer, over the constraint set $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$, of the scalar, quadratic, and \emph{coercive} functional $I$.  (Coercive means that $I(w) \to +\infty$ as $\|w\|_{\mathcal{H}} \to \infty$ \cite{Evans2010}.)  Note that the unconstrained minimum of $I(w)$ over $\mathcal{H}$ may lie outside $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$.  See Figure \ref{fig:cartoonplane}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{genfigs/cartoonplane.pdf}
\caption{Variational inequality \eqref{eq:obstacleviresidual}, equivalently \eqref{eq:obstaclevigradient}, characterizes the minimum $u$ of $I(w)$ over the shaded convex cone $\mathcal{K}_\varphi=\{v\ge \varphi\} \subset \mathcal{H}$.  Any vector $v-u$, for $v$ in $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$, is within $90^\circ$ of $F(u) = \grad I(u)$.}
\label{fig:cartoonplane}
\end{figure}

The (Gateaux) derivative of $I$ is a linear functional in $\mathcal{H}'$:
\begin{equation}
  \grad I(w)[v] = \lim_{\eps\to 0} \frac{I(w+\eps v) - I(w)}{\eps} = a(u,v) - \ip{f}{v}.  \label{eq:gradobjective}
\end{equation}
In fact $\nabla I = F$, the residual, so the VI \eqref{eq:obstacleviresidual} can re-stated yet again:
\begin{equation}
  \nabla I(u)[v-u] \ge 0 \quad \text{ for all } v \text{ in } \mathcal{K}_\varphi. \label{eq:obstaclevigradient}
\end{equation}

Formulation \eqref{eq:obstaclevigradient} permits a clear, geometrical meaning to the VI, as in the Figure.  The solution $u$ sits at a location in $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$, often on the boundary, where any vector pointing into the admissible set, namely $v-u$ for $v$ in $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$, points ``uphill'' on the graph of $I$.  That is, one cannot make minimization progress by moving $u$ to a distinct point $v$ in $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$.  Identifying $\mathcal{H}$ and its dual space $\mathcal{H}'$, one might write \eqref{eq:obstaclevigradient} as ``$\ip{\nabla I(u)}{v-u} \ge 0$'': the angle between $\nabla I(u)$ and $v-u$ is at most 90 degrees.

The solutions shown in the earlier Figure \ref{fig:icelike} recall what points in $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$ actually are, namely functions on $[0,1]$.  When a solution $u$ coincides with the obstacle $\varphi$ on a part of the domain then $u$ is on the boundary of $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$.  In that case arbitrarily-small perturbations $\delta u$, from $\mathcal{H}$, will put $u+\delta u$ outside of $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$.

The glacier problems in sections \ref{sec:sia} and \ref{sec:stokes} will be formulated both as CPs like \eqref{eq:obstaclecp} and VIs like \eqref{eq:obstacleviresidual}.  However, for general bed elevation functions (obstacles) the glacier problem has no constrained minimization formulation like \eqref{eq:obstaclemin}, so the VI formulations have no interpretation like \eqref{eq:obstaclevigradient}.  The essential reason is the lack of a symmetry of the weak form; see \cite{JouvetBueler2012} for the argument in the SIA case.  However, for glacier problems we at least possess a map $F$, from $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$ to $\mathcal{H}'$, and if $u$ solves the VI then, heuristically, $F(u)$ points perpendicularly into $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$.  We may visualize the general VI form \eqref{eq:obstacleviresidual} essentially as in Figure \ref{fig:cartoonplane}, but without the contours of $I$ or the identification of $F$ as a gradient.

Regardless of how the classical obstacle problem is formulated, a \emph{free boundary} generally arises in the interior of the domain.  For example, on either side of the midpoint in Figure \ref{fig:icelike} there are locations where the solution first comes fully in contact with the obstacle.  At these locations both $u=\varphi$ and $u'=\varphi'$ hold, that is, the solution is tangent to the obstacle at the free boundary.  These simultaneous Dirichlet and Neumann conditions occur at a location which must be found as part of the solution; they characterize the free boundary \cite[Chapter V]{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}.  The analogous conditions in the glacier problem are that both the ice thickness and the horizontal ice flux go to zero at a grounded glacier margin \cite{Bueler2016,JouvetBueler2012}.

The solution of the classical obstacle problem will generally be non-smooth at a free boundary even when the data are arbitrarily smooth.  For example, smoothing the source term $f$ in \eqref{eq:icelikedetails} by ``mollification'' \cite{Evans2010}, so that the transition between positive and negative values would be $C^\infty$, would give a solution nearly the same as shown in Figure \ref{fig:icelike} (top).  However, the free boundary would remain, and at that free boundary the second derivative $u''$ would jump discontinuously from value $+16=-f$ to value $-2=\varphi''$.  A similar jump in $u''$ applies at the free boundary in Figure \ref{fig:icelike} (bottom), from $0=f$ to $-16=\varphi''$.  In general it is known that for smooth $C^\infty$ data ($f,\varphi$) the obstacle problem solution $u$ is in the Sobolev space $W^{2,\infty}$, but it is not in $C^2$ \cite[section IV.6]{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}.

\subsection{Smoothers: projected Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi} \label{subsec:obstaclesmoothers}  Now consider the FE method for a VI.  On each mesh level we will define an obstacle $\phi^j$ in $\mathcal{V}^j$, an admissible set $\mathcal{K}^j = \{v \ge \phi^j\} \subset \mathcal{V}^j$, and a residual function $F^j$.  (Recall $\mathcal{V}^j$ is the vector space spanned by the $j$th-level hats $\psi_p^j$; see section \ref{sec:subspace}.)  The FE method seeks $y^j$ in $\mathcal{K}^j$ so that a finite-dimensional VI holds:
\begin{equation}
  F^j(y^j)[v-y^j] \ge 0 \quad \text{ for all } v \text{ in } \mathcal{K}^j. \label{eq:feobstacleviresidual}
\end{equation}

If we were to solve on the fine-level only, i.e.~in a single-level method, then we would choose the obstacle $\phi^J$ to be the piecewise-linear interpolant of the continuum obstacle $\varphi$, i.e.~$\phi^J=\varphi^J$, and $F^J$ as the original residual $F(w)[\cdot] = a(w,\cdot) - \ip{f}{\cdot} = a(w,\cdot) - \ell[\cdot]$.  However, in our multilevel method the constructions of $\phi^j$ and $F^j$ will be nontrivial, even on the finest level.  We will have much more to say regarding the obstacles $\phi^j$, but we will write the residual in the form $F^j(w)[\cdot] = a(w,\cdot) - \ell^j[\cdot]$ for some $\ell^j$ in $(\mathcal{V}^j)'$.

Before addressing the multilevel method we propose an iterative method for solving \eqref{eq:feobstacleviresidual}, namely \emph{projected Gauss-Seidel} (PGS) as a smoother.  Supposing $w$ in $\mathcal{K}^j$ is any iterate, the smoother modifies $w$ at the $p$th node so that \eqref{eq:feobstacleviresidual} holds ``at'' that node, but note that if $w$ is admissible then $w+c\psi_p^j$ is admissible if and only if $w_p + c \ge \phi_p$ where $\phi_p = \phi^j(x_p^j)$.  (\emph{Warning.}  This equivalence holds for piecewise-linear elements, but not generally for higher-order polynomial elements.)  For clarity we describe PGS using the constrained minimization form \eqref{eq:obstaclemin}, using a convex scalar function based on the objective functional.  Let
\begin{equation}
i(b) = I^j(w+b\psi_p^j),
\end{equation}
where $I^j(w) = \frac{1}{2} a(w,w) - \ell^j[w]$ and $b$ is a real number.  At each point $p$ we seek the minimizer over admissible perturbations,
\begin{equation}
  c = \argmin_{b \ge \phi_p - w_p} \, i(b).  \label{eq:pgsminimization}
\end{equation}
The minimum of $i(b)$ on the admissible interval $\phi_p - w_p \le b < \infty$ occurs either at the critical point $i'(b)=0$ or at the left end of the interval.  Since $i'(b) = F^j(w)[\psi_p^j] + b a(\psi_p^j,\psi_p^j)$,
\begin{equation}
  c = \max\left\{-\frac{F^j(w)[\psi_p^j]}{a(\psi_p^j,\psi_p^j)}, \, \phi_p - w_p\right\}  \label{eq:pgsformula}
\end{equation}
solves \eqref{eq:pgsminimization}.  In other words, we compute the critical point and project it into the admissible interval.  Then we update $w \gets w + c\psi_p^j$ and proceed to the next point.

This minimization view of PGS is not essential, however.  We can derive formula \eqref{eq:pgsformula} using only VI \eqref{eq:feobstacleviresidual}, and this will be a useful reference when we consider the glacier model in section \ref{sec:sia}.  We seek $c$ such that $w+c\psi_p^j$ is admissible and so that \eqref{eq:feobstacleviresidual} holds for all admissible $v=w+\tilde c\psi_p^j$.  That is, we find $c\ge \phi_p-w_p$ so that
\begin{equation}
  F^j(w+c\psi_p^j)[(w+\tilde c\psi_p^j) - (w+c\psi_p^j)] = (\tilde c - c) F^j(w+c\psi_p^j)[\psi_p^j] \ge 0,  \label{eq:pgspointwisevi}
\end{equation}
for all $\tilde c\ge \phi_p-w_p$.  Inequality \eqref{eq:pgspointwisevi} is a one-dimensional VI, of form $(\tilde c - c)g(c) \ge 0$ for
\begin{equation}
  g(c) = F^j(w+c\psi_p^j)[\psi_p^j] = F^j(w)[\psi_p^j] + c\,a(\psi_p^j,\psi_p^j),  \label{eq:pgspointwisegfunction}
\end{equation}
on the interval $[\phi_p-w_p,+\infty)$.  Note that the ellipticity of the Poisson equation implies $a(\psi_p^j,\psi_p^j)>0$, thus that $g(c)$ is strictly increasing, and thus that \eqref{eq:pgspointwisevi} is a well-posed VI.  (While $g(c)$ is a linear function with a trivial root-finding problem, the corresponding problem in section \ref{sec:sia} is more interesting.)  Thus $g(c)=0$ or $c$ is at the end of the interval, and thus \eqref{eq:pgsformula}.

The following pseudocode, a small modification of \pr{gs-sweep} on page \pageref{ps:gs-sweep}, implements PGS:
\begin{pseudo*} \label{ps:pgs}
\pr{pgs}(j,w,a,\ell,\phi,\id{omega}=1)\text{:} \\+
    \ct{check admissibility: $w\ge \phi$} \\
    $F(w)[\cdot] := a(w,\cdot) - \ell[\cdot]$ \\
    for $p=1,\dots,m_j$ \\+
        $c = -F(w)[\psi_p^j] \,\big/\, a(\psi_p^j,\psi_p^j)$ \\
        $w_p \gets \max\{w_p + \id{omega}\,c, \phi_p\}$
\end{pseudo*}

As noted in section \ref{sec:subspace}, GS-type (i.e.~multiplicative) smoothers re-evaluate the residual after each point update.  This is an acceptable $O(1)$ cost when the residual of an iterate at a point $x_p^j$ is computable from a few neighboring values, as applies here and in section \ref{sec:sia}.  However, when the residual is nonlocal, and especially when it is both nonlocal and expensive to evaluate, as for the Stokes-based model in section \ref{sec:stokes}, a GS-type smoother becomes less practical.  An alternative is an additive smoother in which the vector residual is evaluated once at the beginning.  The following modifies \pr{jacobi-sweep} on page \pageref{ps:jacobi-sweep}.
\begin{pseudo*} \label{ps:pjacobi}
\pr{pjacobi}(j,w,a,\ell,\phi,\id{omega}=0.67)\text{:} \\+
    \ct{check admissibility: $w\ge \phi$} \\
    $F_p = a(w,\psi_p^j) - \ell[\psi_p^j]$ \\
    for $p=1,\dots,m_j$ \\+
        $c = -F_p \,\big/\, a(\psi_p^j,\psi_p^j)$ \\
        $w_p \gets \max\{w_p + \id{omega}\,c, \phi_p\}$
\end{pseudo*}
(We could also describe this smoother as a projected forward Euler step (section \ref{sec:subspace}), i.e.~as a step of the common time-evolution method in glacier and ice sheet models \cite[for example]{Winkelmannetal2011}.)  Assuming each pointwise residual $F(w)[\psi_p^j]$ is an $O(1)$ operation in the $j$th-level representation, \pr{pgs} and \pr{pjacobi} are $O(m_j)$ operations.  The latter remains $O(m_j)$ as long as the vector residual and the diagonal entries can be computed in $O(m_j)$ operations given $w$, even if individual pointwise residuals are not $O(1)$.

For appropriate ranges of \id{omega} both algorithms above are known to converge to the solution $y^j$ of VI problem \eqref{eq:feobstacleviresidual} \cite[Proposition 4.5]{GraeserKornhuber2009}, but, of course, slowly on fine meshes.  Regarding the relaxation parameter \id{omega}, recall that the optimal value for the Poisson equation is \id{omega} $=2/3$ \cite{Briggsetal2000}, but finding the most-effective smoother values for obstacle problems is a topic for numerical experimentation.

However, for VI problems the residual norm $\|F(w)\|_2$ does not generally go to zero at the convergence of the iterations.  Recalling the CP formulation \eqref{eq:obstaclecp}, at convergence we have $F(w)[\psi_p^j] = 0$ where $w(x_p^j) > \phi(x_p^j)$ (inactive points), but if $w(x_p^j) = \phi(x_p^j)$ (active points) then $F(w)[\psi_p^j]$ is only required to be nonnegative.  Thus the convergence criterion for iterated PGS sweeps is that the norm of the \emph{CP residual}, the vector
\begin{equation}
  (\hat \bF(w))_p = \begin{cases} F(w)[\psi_p^j], & w_p > \phi_p, \\
                                  \min\{F(w)[\psi_p^j],0\}, & \text{otherwise}, \end{cases} \label{eq:cpresidual}
\end{equation}
in $\RR^{m_j}$, should be small.  Then our relative-norm convergence criterion will be
\begin{equation}
\|\hat\bF(w)\|_2 < \text{\texttt{rtol}}\,\|\hat\bF(w^0)\|_2 \label{eq:cpconvergencecriterion}
\end{equation}
for some tolerance \id{rtol}.

The above projected iterations will serve as our smoothers, applied one or two times on each level, and as the coarse-level solver as well.  However, we are not yet prepared to build a multilevel method for problem \eqref{eq:feobstacleviresidual} because the nontrivial construction of the obstacles $\phi^j$ and residuals $F^j$ remains.  We need to decompose the continuum constraint $\varphi$ across the mesh-level hierarchy, and we need to construct admissible multilevel corrections.

\subsection{Multilevel constraint decomposition} \label{subsec:mcd}  How do we maintain admissibility throughout a multilevel cycle while not introducing high-frequencies?

Consider the coarse-level correction $e^{j-1}$ in a linear V-cycle (section \ref{sec:subspace}, equation \eqref{eq:coarsecorrection}), which is prolonged onto the $j$th level.  For an obstacle problem the resulting iterate would need to be admissible, i.e.~$w + P e^{j-1}$ would need to be above the obstacle, say $\varphi^j$.  However, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:prolongobstacle}, if the obstacles are interpolants of a (common) continuum obstacle $\varphi$ then an iterate which is admissible on the $j-1$ level is \emph{not} necessarily admissible on the $j$ level.  (In the glacier context, a coarse-mesh ice surface may be breached by the fine-mesh bed topography.)  We might try enforcing admissibility by \emph{truncation}, namely overwriting $\tilde w = w + Pe^{j-1}$ with $\max\{\tilde w, \varphi^j\}$.  However, this reintroduces high frequencies, requiring additional smoother effort to remove, and generally damaging multigrid convergence rates.

\begin{figure}
\qquad \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{genfigs/prolongobstacle.pdf}
\caption{If the obstacles interpolate a common continuum obstacle then an admissible iterate on a coarse level, when prolonged, may not be admissible on a finer level.}
\label{fig:prolongobstacle}
\end{figure}

One way forward is the \emph{multilevel constraint decomposition} (MCD) method of Tai \cite{Tai2003}, described here using the specific decomposition proposed in \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009}.  Suppose $w^J$ in $\mathcal{V}^J$, on the finest level, is admissible in the original sense that
\begin{equation}
  w^J \ge \varphi^J, \label{eq:fineadmissibleiterate}
\end{equation}
where $\varphi^J$ interpolates the continuum obstacle.  Define the \emph{defect constraint} \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009} of $w^J$ as
\begin{equation}
  \chi^J = \varphi^J - w^J.  \label{eq:defectconstraint}
\end{equation}
Note $\chi^J \le 0$.  The meaning of $\chi^J$ is that if we modify $w^J$ by adding $y$ then the result is admissible if and only if $y$ is above $\chi^J$:
\begin{equation}
  w^J + y \ge \varphi^J  \qquad \iff \qquad y \ge \chi^J.  \label{eq:defectmeaning}
\end{equation}

Our MCD method will \emph{put as much of $\chi^J$ into the coarsest levels as possible}.  That is, our decomposition of $\chi^J$ determines how constrained the coarse-level corrections are, and we want to allow the largest corrections on the inexpensive coarse levels.  For this purpose, following \cite[equation (4.22)]{GraeserKornhuber2009}, we define a nonlinear \emph{monotone restriction} operator $\mR$ from $\mathcal{V}^j$ to $\mathcal{V}^{j-1}$.  For $z$ in $\mathcal{V}^j$, $\mR z$ is computed by maximizing nodal values of $z$ over the interior of the support of coarser-level hat functions.  That is, if $z = \sum_q z_q \psi_q^j$ on the fine level then
\begin{equation}
  \mR z = \sum_{p=1}^{m_{j-1}} \zeta_p \psi_p^{j-1} \qquad \text{where} \qquad \zeta_p = \max \{z_q \,:\, \psi_p^{j-1}(x_q^j) > 0\}.  \label{eq:monotonerestriction}
\end{equation}
Observe that $\mR z \ge z$.  Also note that $\mR$ acts on functions $\mathcal{V}^j$ while canonical restriction $R$ acts on linear functionals $(\mathcal{V}^j)'$; see Table \ref{tab:transfers}.

We then define the \emph{$j$th-level defect constraint} inductively by
\begin{equation}
  \chi^j = \mR \chi^{j+1}  \label{eq:chik}
\end{equation}
for $j=J-1$ down to $j=0$.  These defect constraints have two key properties: $\chi^j$ is in $\mathcal{V}^j$ and $\chi^j \ge \chi^{j+1}$.  (One may also write $P \chi^j \ge \chi^{j+1}$.)

The \emph{$j$th-level obstacle} is the difference of defect constraints:
\begin{equation}
  \phi^j = \chi^j - \chi^{j-1} \quad \text{ for } j=0,1,\dots,J,  \label{eq:levelobstacle}
\end{equation}
where we also define $\chi^{-1}=0$ so that $\phi^0 = \chi^0$.  Note $\phi^j$ is in $\mathcal{V}^j$ and $\phi^j\le 0$.

We have now decomposed the fine-level defect constraint $\chi^J$ via a telescoping sum:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{j=0}^J \phi^j = \chi^0 + (\chi^1 - \chi^0) + (\chi^2 - \chi^1) + \dots + (\chi^J - \chi^{J-1}) = \chi^J.  \label{eq:telescopingdecomposition}
\end{equation}
An example is shown in Figure \ref{fig:gooddecomposition}.  Note that the obstacles $\phi^j$ are the gaps between the plotted defect constraints $\chi^j$.  If the $J$th level is a high-resolution mesh and the defect constraint $\chi^J$ is smooth then $\phi^J\approx 0$ because $\chi^J$ is well-approximated on the $J-1$ level.

From the obstacles $\phi^j$ we define closed, convex \emph{admissible (correction) sets}
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{K}^j = \left\{v \ge \phi^j\right\} \subset \mathcal{V}^j \label{eq:defineKj}
\end{equation}
for $j=0,1,\dots,J$.  Because $\phi^j \le 0$, the zero function is admissible on every level.  On the finest level, note that $\phi^J$ is not the same as $\varphi^J$, and so $\mathcal{K}^J$ does not approximate $\mathcal{K}_\varphi$.

We also define the $j$th-level \emph{defect constraint set}
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{D}^j = \left\{v \ge \chi^j\right\} \subset \mathcal{V}^j.  \label{eq:constraintset}
\end{equation}
From the telescoping sum \eqref{eq:telescopingdecomposition}, the admissible correction sets $\mathcal{K}^j$ decompose $\mathcal{D}^j$:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{D}^j = \mathcal{K}^0 + \mathcal{K}^1 + \dots + \mathcal{K}^j. \label{eq:constraintdecomposition}
\end{equation}
That is, every $y$ in $\mathcal{D}^j$ can be built by choosing a function from each of the sets $\mathcal{K}^0,\dots,\mathcal{K}^j$.  As with \eqref{eq:subspacedecomposition}, this representation is usually not unique.

Subset equation \eqref{eq:constraintdecomposition} is close to the core meaning of the MCD method.  As shown in Figure \ref{fig:innerconeapprox}, this decomposition implies a nesting of cones:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{D}^0 \subset \mathcal{D}^1 \subset \dots \subset \mathcal{D}^J.  \label{eq:nestedcones}
\end{equation}
In particular, the fine-level defect constraint set $\mathcal{D}^J = \{v \ge \chi^J\}$ is approximated ``from within'' by coarser-level cones, the partial sums $\mathcal{D}^j = \sum_{k=0}^j \mathcal{K}^k$.  The smaller sets $\mathcal{K}^j$ are also cones, but they are not nested.  However, though $\mathcal{K}^j$ and $\mathcal{D}^j$ are cone relatives to $\phi^j$ and $\chi^j$, respectively, they are not closed under addition, and therefore corrections must be carefully applied, with attention to admissibility of the new iterate \eqref{eq:defectmeaning}, especially in a V-cycle (see below).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{genfigs/innerconeapprox.pdf}

\caption{The MCD method approximates the fine-level defect constraint cone $\mathcal{D}^J = \{v\ge \chi^J\}$ from inside by coarse-level cones $\mathcal{D}^j=\mathcal{K}^0+\dots+\mathcal{K}^j$.}
\label{fig:innerconeapprox}
\end{figure}

Looking forward to the glacier problem in section \ref{sec:sia}, the fine-mesh obstacle $\varphi^J$ will be the bed elevation, $w^J$ will be a candidate ice surface elevation on the fine mesh, and $-\chi^J$ will be the corresponding ice thickness.  With this in mind, Figure \ref{fig:icelikedecomposition} illustrates the same constraint decomposition as in Figure \ref{fig:gooddecomposition}, but pictured as a decomposition of the ``ice'' into layers.  (Compared to Figure \ref{fig:icelike} (top), the ``topography'' $\varphi^J$ here is bumpy.)  However, the earlier Figure plots the decomposition in the correct sense, so that the functions $\chi^j$ and $\phi^j$ are piecewise-linear, and so that the zero correction is admissible on every level.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fixfigs/icedec_defect.pdf}
\caption{A heuristic understanding of Figure \ref{fig:gooddecomposition}: MCD decomposes the ``ice'' between a fine-mesh iterate $w^J$ and the fine-mesh obstacle $\varphi^J$.}
\label{fig:icelikedecomposition}
\end{figure}

\subsection{MCD coarse-level corrections} \label{subsec:mcdcorrections}  On each mesh level there is now an obstacle problem, and we will write it in three forms.  The forms are equivalent for the classical obstacle problem, but only one will generalize to the glacier problems in sections \ref{sec:sia} and \ref{sec:stokes}.  For now, recall that $F(w)[v] = a(w,v) - \ip{f}{v}$ denotes the continuum residual \eqref{eq:residual}, and then $I(v) = \frac{1}{2} a(v,v) - \ip{f}{v}$ is the corresponding objective function.

Again suppose $w^J$ is an admissible iterate on the fine level: $w^J\ge \varphi^J$.  Assume that we have already descended from the fine level $J$ to some level $j+1$, computing admissible corrections $y^k$ from each set $\mathcal{K}^k=\{v\ge \phi^k\}$, for $k\ge j+1$.  From the definitions of $\chi^J$ and $\mathcal{D}^J$, the function $z = w^J+y^J+\dots+y^{j+1}$ is admissible in the original sense, i.e.~$z\ge \varphi^J$.  The MCD \emph{coarse-level correction} is a function $y$ in $\mathcal{K}^j=\{v\ge \phi^j\}$ such that one of the following holds:
\begin{itemize}
\item general variational inequality \cite{Tai2003}:
\begin{equation}
  F(w^J+y^J+\dots+y^{j+1}+y)[v - y] \ge 0 \qquad \text{for all } v \text{ in } \mathcal{K}^j.  \label{eq:mcdvi}
\end{equation}
\item constrained minimization \cite{Tai2003}:
\begin{equation}
  y = \argmin_{v \text{ in } \mathcal{K}^j} I(w^J+y^J+\dots+y^{j+1}+v).  \label{eq:mcdminimization}
\end{equation}
\item linear variational inequality \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009}:
\begin{equation}
  F^j(y)[v - y] \ge 0 \qquad \text{for all } v \text{ in } \mathcal{K}^j.   \label{eq:mcdvilinear}
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
In the first form $F$ does not need to be linear, and similarly $I$ in the second form does not need to be quadratic.  Note that this initial description of the problem defines a down-slash cycle (see Figure \ref{fig:msccycles}), but we will show how to generalize to a V-cycle.  In any case a coarse-level correction $y$ in $\mathcal{K}^j$ is defined for every level in the hierarchy, $j=0,\dots,J$.

The third form \eqref{eq:mcdvilinear} exploits linearity of $F$ to inductively define residual functionals which do not directly refer to the fine-level admissible states $z^j = w^J+y^J+\dots+y^{j+1}+y$:
\begin{align}
  F^j(y)[\cdot] &= F(z^j)[\cdot] \label{eq:residuallinearlevelderive} \\
                &= a(w^J+y^J+\dots+y^{j+1}+y,\cdot) - \ip{f}{\cdot} \notag \\
                &= a(y,\cdot) + F^{j+1}(y^{j+1})[\cdot]. \notag
\end{align}
That is, we construct each new source term,
\begin{equation}
  \tilde\ell^j[\cdot] = \begin{cases} - F^{j+1}(y^{j+1})[\cdot], & j < J, \\
                                      - F(w^J)[\cdot],   & j = J, \end{cases} \label{eq:rhslinearlevel}
\end{equation}
thereby define a residual functional on each level,
\begin{equation}
  F^j(y)[\cdot] = a(y,\cdot) - \tilde\ell^j[\cdot].  \label{eq:residuallinearlevel}
\end{equation}
Here $F^j$ is actually defined on $\mathcal{V}^h$, that is, on the whole FE space, and $\tilde\ell^j$ is in $(\mathcal{V}^h)'$.  However, smoothing will occur before each coarse correction, and so we will use the canonical restriction to approximate $\tilde\ell^j$ by a linear functional $\ell^j$ in the coarse-level space $(\mathcal{V}^j)'$; see \eqref{eq:restrictedrhslinearlevel} below.

For the classical obstacle problem, wherein the residual $F(w)[v]$ is built from a symmetric bilinear form $a(w,v)$, the three problems \eqref{eq:mcdvi}--\eqref{eq:mcdvilinear} are equivalent:
   $$\eqref{eq:mcdvilinear} \quad \stackrel{a \text{ bilinear}}{\iff\strut} \quad \eqref{eq:mcdvi} \quad \stackrel{F=\grad I}{\iff\strut} \quad \eqref{eq:mcdminimization}.$$
The left equivalence depends on linearity, and the right on symmetry, but VI form \eqref{eq:mcdvi} in the middle is the most general.  It is the one we will apply for glacier problems.

When $F$ is not the gradient of a coercive objective function, e.g.~as in the SIA and Stokes glacier problems, additional structural properties of $F$ are required for well-posedness (e.g.~monotonicity \cite{Bueler2020,JouvetBueler2012,KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}).  However, we will assume well-posedness and proceed with the numerics.

\subsection{Linear MCD cycles} \label{subsec:mcdl}  Now we may implement multilevel cycles for the classical obstacle problem.  Because the interior PDE of this problem is the linear Poisson equation, we solve form \eqref{eq:mcdvilinear} and name the method \pr{MCDL}, with L for ``linear''.  A general nonlinear MCD algorithm is applied to glacier problems in sections \ref{sec:sia} and \ref{sec:stokes}.

We represent functions and linear functionals in the piecewise-linear spaces $\mathcal{V}^j$ and $(\mathcal{V}^j)'$ just as in section \ref{sec:subspace}.  To address how the correction problem is actually moved onto the coarser level, note that equations \eqref{eq:rhslinearlevel} and \eqref{eq:residuallinearlevel} will be applied after smoothing of the previous correction $y^{j+1}$, so we approximate the residual by applying canonical restriction,
\begin{equation}
\ell^j[\cdot] = R \tilde\ell^j[\cdot] = \begin{cases} - R(F^{j+1}(y^{j+1}))[\cdot], & j < J, \\
                                                      - F(w^J)[\cdot],   & j = J, \end{cases} \label{eq:restrictedrhslinearlevel}
\end{equation}
and then we define $F^j(y)[\cdot] = a(y,\cdot) - \ell^j[\cdot]$.  In using $\ell^j$ instead of $\tilde\ell^j$ we lose any high-frequency residual information in $y^{j+1}$ which remains after smoothing.

Implementing formulae \eqref{eq:defectconstraint}, \eqref{eq:chik}, \eqref{eq:levelobstacle}, \eqref{eq:defineKj}, \eqref{eq:mcdvilinear}, and \eqref{eq:restrictedrhslinearlevel} produces a V(1,0) down-slash cycle, namely Algorithm 4.7 in \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009}.

However, once all the corrections $y^j$ are computed on the way down, admissible up-smoothing is more forgiving.  For instance, if we have computed $y^1$ in $\mathcal{K}^1$ and $y^0$ in $\mathcal{K}^0$ then prolongation and accumulation gives $\tilde z = P y^0 + y^1$ in $\mathcal{D}^1 = \mathcal{K}^0 + \mathcal{K}^1$, which we may smooth to $z^1$ in $\mathcal{D}^1$.  In other words, obstacles $\phi^j$ can be regarded as the down-obstacles while the defect constraints $\chi^j$ are the up-obstacles; see Figure \ref{fig:mcdvcycle}.  The observation of this asymmetry permits a better algorithm.  (It also justifies some of the complexity of notation in the previous subsection.)

\begin{figure}
\input{tikz/mcdvcycle.tex}
\caption{Going down, \pr{mcdl-vcycle} computes a correction $y_j$ in $\mathcal{K}^j = \{v\ge \phi_j\}$, but its upward-accumulated correction $z_j$ expands into the larger set $\mathcal{D}^j = \{v \ge \chi_j\}$.}
\label{fig:mcdvcycle}
\end{figure}

The following V-cycle pseudocode uses \pr{pgs} or \pr{pjacobi} as the smoother and coarse-level solver.  It takes $F^J$, defined via \eqref{eq:restrictedrhslinearlevel}, as an argument, and not the original $F$; this V-cycle only knows about the fine-level iterate $w^J$ through $F^J$ and $\chi^J$.  The result is a fine-level correction $z^J$; see \pr{mcdl-solver} next.

    return $z^J$
\end{pseudo*}

In agreement with Algorithm 4.7 in \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009}, the default \id{down} and \id{up} settings give a V(1,0) cycle.  However, any V(\id{down},\id{up}) cycle is allowed, and we will test V(1,0), V(0,1), and V(1,1)\footnote{Reference \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009} describes extending from V(1,0) cycles to V(1,1) cycles by splitting the obstacles $\phi^j$, but it is not clear how this should be implemented.  In any case, our implementation allows larger coarse-level corrections.} cycles below.  Also, in the implementation the functions $F^j(y)[\cdot]$ are not passed as functions in the pro\-gramming-language sense.  Rather, assuming a subroutine which evaluates $a(w,v)$ on each level, the linear functional $\ell^{j-1}$ is passed, from which $F^{j-1}$ is constructed in the smoother.

The following in-place solver adds an outer loop which sets-up the fine-level data $\chi^J$ and $\ell^J$, calls the V-cycle, and checks for convergence.  Note that one must call this solver with an admissible initial iterate; $w=\varphi^J$ is one possibility.  Compare \pr{msc-solver} in section \ref{sec:subspace}.

\subsection{Convergence of the numerical error} \label{subsec:obstacleconvergence}  All of the pseudocodes in the current section have been implemented in Python.\footnote{At\, \href{https://github.com/bueler/mg-glaciers/}{\texttt{github.com/bueler/mg-glaciers/}} see the \texttt{py/1D/} directory and its \texttt{README.md}.}  To verify these implementations, and to demonstrate the differences in numerical error convergence rates between the obstacle problem and the corresponding unconstrained PDE, we use three exact solutions.  The first two are already shown in Figure \ref{fig:icelike}; note that the ``ice-like'' case has a discontinuous source $f$, while ``traditional'' has $f=0$, but both have smooth, parabolic obstacles.  The third ``unconstrained'' exact solution is for a variable-coefficient equation $-\left((2+\sin(2\pi x)) u'\right)'=f$ on the interval $[0,10]$.  (Here the obstacle is low enough so that all points are inactive and all smoothing steps avoid projection.)

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{genfigs/convergence.pdf}
\caption{MCDL method convergence for three cases with known exact solutions.}
\label{fig:convergence}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:convergence} shows the numerical error norm $\|u^h-u\|_2$ as a function of mesh spacing $h$ for runs with \id{rtol} $=10^{-7}$.  We focus on the convergence rate; the absolute error size is unimportant.  For ``traditional'' it is the best possible, as $O(h^2)$ rate is expected for PDEs \cite{Elmanetal2014}, as seen here.  The ``ice-like'' rate is poor because of the lower regularity of $f$.  Note that the low regularity of obstacle problem solutions will have a greater effect on 2D or 3D convergence rates.

\subsection{Performance: results and theory} \label{subsec:obstacleperformance}  In this section we evaluate the performance of V-cycles computed by our implementation of MCDL.  We will count iterations, measure work units (defined below), and measure run time.  We will conclude that MCDL for the classical obstacle problem is not quite as efficient as GMG for the Poisson equation.  Performance depends weakly on mesh resolution, a result supported by theory, but the performance of MCDL remains far better than single-level approaches.

We compare the performance of five MCDL solvers:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textsf{V(1,0)}: \id{down} $=1$ and \id{up} $=0$ in \pr{mcdl-vcycle}
\item \textsf{V(0,1)}: \id{down}, \id{up} $=0,1$
\item \textsf{V(1,1)}: \id{down}, \id{up} $=1,1$
\item \textsf{V(0,2)}: \id{down}, \id{up} $=0,2$
\item \textsf{V(0,2)-Jacobi}: \id{down}, \id{up} $=0,2$, with \pr{pjacobi} smoothing using \id{omega} $=0.67$
\end{itemize}
The first two solvers are down- and up-slash cycles, respectively.  The first four solvers use the default \pr{pgs} smoother.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{genfigs/mcdl-cycles.pdf}
\caption{Number of iterations (V-cycles) as a function of $m$.}
\label{fig:mcdl-cycles}
\end{figure}

We test these solvers on the ``icelike'' problem shown in Figure \ref{fig:icelike}, iterating until convergence by the default criterion, \eqref{eq:cpconvergencecriterion} with \id{rtol} $=10^{-3}$.  Figure \ref{fig:mcdl-cycles} shows the number of iterations (cycles) for mesh hierarchies with $J=6,\dots,15$ refinements, thus $m_J=2^{J+1}-1$ degrees of freedom (nodes) values up to $m_{15}=6.5 \times 10^4$.  The number of iterations grows slowly in each case, with V(1,1) and V(0,2) tied for the fewest.  As explained when we constructed MCD cycles, the constraints on the up-smoother are less severe than on the down-smoother, and indeed we see that the up-slash V(0,1) cycles are better than down-slash V(1,0).

By doing logarithmic regression to the data, the Figure shows our result that iterations grow as $O(m^q)$ for $0.10 \le q \le 0.12$.  Recalling Theorem \ref{thm:mscconvergence}, for the Poisson equation this rate would be $O(1) = O(m^0)$ in theory.  When we run our code in an unconstrained case we see that only 5 or 6 V(1,1) cycles are needed for all resolutions, for example (not shown).  Thus more MCDL V-cycles are needed for the obstacle problem than for elliptic PDEs with smooth solutions, and the iterate counts grow slowly with mesh refinement.  This reflects both lower solution regularity and the need to locate the discrete free boundary; we will consider the relevant theory momentarily.

In terms of relative performance among the solvers, counting iterations is unfair because, for example, one V(1,1) cycle does more work than one V(1,0) or V(0,1).  Thus we compare \emph{work units} (WU).  By definition, one WU is the amount of computation done by one smoother application on the fine level \cite{Briggsetal2000}.  Since a $J$th-level smoother sweep is 1 WU, a $J-1$ level sweep is $\frac{1}{2}$ WU in 1D, and so on geometrically down the hierarchy.  In the limit $J\to\infty$, one slash cycle in 1D costs 2 WU,\footnote{Not counting the work of transfer operators.} by summing the obvious geometric series, and generally a V-cycle costs $O(1)$ WU as a function of $m$.

Our programs count their WU,\footnote{Our Python implementation has a class for each mesh level.  The mesh hierarchy is a list of such mesh-level objects.  The WU for a level is a class attribute which gets incremented by each smoother sweep.  Computing the total WU at the end of a run is an easy weighted sum.} and Figure \ref{fig:mcdl-wu} shows the total WU for the same runs.  Just like for iterations, total WU grows as $O(m^q)$ for $0.10 \le q \le 0.12$, but we now see that the \pr{pgs}-based cycles are all comparable, and much stronger than the \pr{pjacobi} cycles.  However, Jacobi smoothing will remain significant in our applications to glacier problems (section \ref{sec:stokes}).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{genfigs/mcdl-wu.pdf}
\caption{Number of work units (WU) as a function of $m$.  The \pr{pgs} smoother is clearly more efficient.}
\label{fig:mcdl-wu}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, these MCDL growth rates for work are excellent compared to application of the smoother by itself as a single-level method.  Though most runs in the Figure are unattainable by such a single-level method, we find that 6802, 26986, and 108562 iterations, equivalently WU, are required on the three coarsest resolutions ($J=6,7,8$), respectively, a catastrophic growth rate of $O(m^{1.99})$.  This growth rate is also well-supported by theory; see below.
% for JJ in 6 7 8; do ./obstacle.py -cyclemax 200000 -sweepsonly -jfine $JJ; done

Finally we look at the time per degree of freedom.  This quantity should be constant, $O(1)=O(m^0)$ for an optimal method.  Figure \ref{fig:mcdl-timeper} shows the results for the finer $J=9,\dots,15$ meshes.  Fitting only to the five finest results, because timing for smaller runs is dominated by Python executable start-up costs, the time-per-$m$ is $O(m^r)$ for $0.01 \le r \le 0.05$, so mesh dependence is very modest.  Our \pr{pgs} solvers all require less than 1 millisecond per degree of freedom.  Though this value depends completely on the details of our Python implementation, and on the physical computer, it can be compared to the more expensive computations for the glacier problems in sections \ref{sec:sia} and \ref{sec:stokes}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{genfigs/mcdl-timeper.pdf}
\caption{Run time per degrees of freedom $m$ as a function of $m$.}
\label{fig:mcdl-timeper}
\end{figure}

Mathematical theory allows us to understand most of the above performance results.   Denote the spacing of the fine ($J$th) mesh by $h$.  Let $u^h$ be the exact solution of the finite-dimensional VI which is the direct FE approximation of \eqref{eq:obstacleviresidual}:
\begin{equation}
  F(u^h)[v-u^h] \ge 0 \quad \text{ for all } v \text{ in $\mathcal{V}^h=\mathcal{V}^J$ such that } v \ge \varphi^J. \label{eq:feobstaclevioriginal}
\end{equation}
(Compare \eqref{eq:feobstacleviresidual} which we solve on each level in MCD.)  Also recall that for the classical obstacle problem the residual is the gradient of an objective function $I(w)$.

First consider the single-level PGS method.  The following theorem describes the rate at which the norm of the algebraic error decreases.

\begin{theorem} \cite[Prop.~4.5]{GraeserKornhuber2009}\,  \label{thm:pgsconvergence}  Suppose $w^{(s)}$  results from $s$ applications of \pr{pgs-sweep} on the fine level, starting with any $w^{(0)}$.  There is $C>0$, independent of $h$ and $s$, so that
\begin{equation}
  \|w^{(s)} - u^h\|_{\mathcal{H}}^2 \le 2 (1-C h^2)^s\,\left(I(w^{(0)}) - I(u^h)\right).  \label{eq:pgsconvergence}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

Inequality \eqref{eq:pgsconvergence} compares the algebraic error norm of an iterate to the initial objective error.  While the right-hand side looks complicated, the only $s$ dependence is the power on the factor $\rho_{\text{PGS}} = \sqrt{1-Ch^2}$.  The theorem says that the rate at which $\|w^{(s)} - u^h\|_{\mathcal{H}}$ goes to zero, as $s\to \infty$, is $O((\rho_{\text{PGS}})^s)$.  However, as we refine the mesh, $h\to 0$, the value of $\rho_{\text{PGS}} = 1 - O(h^2)$ goes to one so that the iteration becomes stagnant.  (In MCDL we are using PGS as a coarse solver, an application in which the convergence rate should still be good.)  If we seek to reduce the error norm below $\eps$ then we expect to need $O(|\log\eps|/h^2)$ iterations, a number which increases rapidly as $h\to 0$.

For MCD methods an error bound with a far superior rate has been proven by Tai \cite{Tai2003}.  For our 1D classical obstacle problem, as proven in \cite[section 5.4]{Tai2003}, using inequality (4.13) of \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009} to give a form comparable to Theorem \ref{thm:pgsconvergence}, the result is as follows.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:mcdconvergence}  Suppose $s$ applications of \pr{mcdl-vcycle}, using $J$ levels in the mesh hierarchy, yields $w^{(s)}$.  There are positive constants $c_0$, $c_1$, independent of $h$ and $J$ and $s$, so that
\begin{equation}
  \|w^{(s)} - u^h\|_{\mathcal{H}}^2 \le 2 \left(1-\frac{c_0}{1+c_1 J}\right)^s\,\left(I(w^{(0)}) - I(u^h)\right).  \label{eq:mcdconvergence}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

Recalling our observation (section \ref{sec:subspace}) that $J = O(|\log h|)$, the MCD convergence rate
\begin{equation}
  \rho_{\text{MCD}} = 1-\frac{c_0}{1+c_1 J}  = 1 - O(J^{-1}) = 1 - O(|\log h|^{-1}) \label{eq:definemcdrate}
\end{equation}
is of completely-different character from $\rho_{\text{PGS}}$.  While $\rho_{\text{MCD}}$ still goes to one in the mesh refinement limit ($h \to 0$), it does so very slowly.  That is, instead of having the convergence rate degrade directly with the mesh spacing, it \emph{determined by the number of levels} in the mesh hierarchy.

We now have three comparable convergence theorems, namely Theorems \ref{thm:mscconvergence}, \ref{thm:pgsconvergence}, and \ref{thm:mcdconvergence}.  They form a theoretical performance-model framework for the respective solvers, as summarized by Table \ref{tab:performancemodels}.  Only \pr{gmg-vcycle} is strictly optimal $O(m)$, but of course it only solves unconstrained PDE problems.  The observed modestly-suboptimal MCDL performance, basically $O(m^{1.1})$ as shown in Figures \ref{fig:mcdl-cycles}--\ref{fig:mcdl-timeper}, is completely compatible with the theoretical $O(m\log m)$ model.

MCD convergence Theorem \ref{thm:mcdconvergence} actually applies to certain nonlinear VI problems.  However, the proof requires a constrained-minimization formulation and a uniform-ellipticity bound \cite{Tai2003}, and the glacier problems in sections \ref{sec:sia} and \ref{sec:stokes} satisfy neither hypothesis.  In this paper we will not pursue the theory further, but we will measure the performance of our MCD approaches on glacier problems.  Our standing assumption is that MCDL performance for the 1D classical obstacle problem represents the best-possible result.

\subsection{Nested iteration} \label{subsec:obstaclefcycles}  We must consider a technique which can substantially-improve multilevel performance.  In \emph{nested iteration} \cite{Trottenbergetal2001} an initial iterate comes from prolonging a converged iterate from a coarser mesh.  If we then solve on each level by V-cycles then the resulting \emph{full multigrid} method does an \emph{F-cycle} (Figure \ref{fig:fcycle}).  That is, an F-cycle results from concatenating V-cycles using the solution prolongation.  Note that while a correction $y^{j-1}$ is prolonged in a V-cycle, now we also need to prolong the iterate $w^{j-1}$ itself, and the result needs to be admissible.

\begin{figure}
\input{tikz/fcycle.tex}
\caption{An F-cycle prepends shallower V-cycles, with a new prolongation $\hat P$ (double lines) generating the initial iterate on each starting level.}
\label{fig:fcycle}
\end{figure}

Though $w^{j-1} \ge \varphi^{j-1}$ is admissible on its level, the information in the finer obstacle $\varphi^j$ has not yet been ``seen'', so truncation is obligatory for admissibility, and we define \emph{solution prolongation} using canonical prolongation \eqref{eq:canonicalprolongation} and truncation:
\begin{equation}
\hat P w^{j-1} = \max\{P w^{j-1}, \varphi^{j}\}  \label{eq:solutionprolongation}
\end{equation}
After creating this initial iterate we do one or more V-cycles.  The following pseudocode implements this strategy.  Note there is no convergence criterion; the number of cycles is fixed.
\begin{pseudo*} \label{ps:mcdl-fcycle}
\pr{mcdl-fcycle}(J,w^0,a,f,\varphi,\id{nicycles}=1)\text{:} \\+
    $\varphi^0 = \ct{interpolant of $\varphi$}$ \\
    for $j=0,\dots,J$ \\+
        $\ell^j[\cdot] := \ip{f}{\cdot}$ \\
        for $s=1,\dots,\id{nicycles}$ \qquad\qquad\qquad \ct{one or more V-cycles} \\+
            $\chi^j = \varphi^j - w^j$ \\
            $w^j \gets w^j+\pr{mcdl-vcycle}(j,a,\ell^j,\chi^j)$ \\-
        if $j < J$ \\+
            $\varphi^{j+1} = \ct{interpolant of $\varphi$}$ \\
            $w^{j+1} = \hat P w^j$ \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \ct{initial iterate for next level} \\--
    return $w^J$
\end{pseudo*}
Note that the input $w^0$ could be $\varphi^0$ or any other admissible iterate on the coarsest level.  Also observe that when \pr{mcdl-vcycle} is called on the coarsest level it reduces to the coarse solver.

For PDEs one F-cycle often suffices to reach discretization error \cite{Trottenbergetal2001}.  However, because obstacle problem solutions have lower regularity, and because multilevel cycles are required to both remove low frequencies from the error \emph{and} find the discrete free boundary, performance is lower, as we will see.  In practice, the F-cycle can generate an initial fine-level iterate, but application of additional V-cycles, i.e.~of \pr{mcdl-solver}, is needed to converge according to a residual (or error) norm tolerance.

To show MCDL F-cycles in the best light, consider the ``traditional'' exact solution shown in Figure \ref{fig:icelike}.  By using a tight tolerance (\id{rtol} $=10^{-7}$) and as many V(1,1) cycles as necessary, we first compute the discretization error for this problem on meshes with $J=2,\dots,12$ (stars in Figure \ref{fig:perfni}).  Now we run \pr{mcdl-fcycle} with its defaults, with one V(1,1) cycle per level, and then with two (\id{nicycles} $=2$).  Note these F-cycles are very fast, with $J\to\infty$ asymptotic WU values of 8 and 16, respectively.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{genfigs/perfni.pdf}
\caption{For the classical obstacle problem, F-cycles with one or two V(1,1) cycles per level do not attain discretization error.}
\label{fig:perfni}
\end{figure}

However, the corresponding figure for an unconstrained problem shows that the F-cycles yield error norms within a factor of two of discretization error (not shown).  That is, in the PDE case the markers are on top of each other for all mesh levels.  Classical obstacle problem F-cycles do generate small errors, especially given the amount of work, but our results here are qualitatively-worse than for the unconstrained Poisson equation.  Furthermore, F-cycle performance on the ``ice-like'' exact obstacle problem solution (Figure \ref{fig:icelike}), which has lower regularity than ``traditional'', is both worse and less consistent (not shown).  The F-cycle solution can be ``lucky'', or not, when locating the free boundary on coarser levels, and this dominates the fine-level discretization error from one F-cycle.  In summary, nested iterations (F-cycles) are likely to be a useful tool, but they are not as miraculous as expected from smooth PDE cases.

Many variations on V- and F-cycle strategies have not been tested in this section.  Most significantly, reference \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009} describes monotone, truncated, and Newton-based multigrid methods for obstacle problems which extend the MCD method.  These methods improve performance for the classical problem when the coincidence set (active set) is geometrically complicated, but they require greater implementation effort, essentially because they keep track of the discrete active set.  There is also the discrete complementarity-problem ``PFAS'' method of \cite{BrandtCryer1983} (see below), while \cite{Blumetal2004} proposes a ``cascadic'' approach with a conjugate-gradient smoother.


\section{MCD for the shallow-ice mass conservation problem} \label{sec:sia}

\subsection{The shallow-ice obstacle problem} \label{subsec:siaproblem}  Now we consider a nonlinear obstacle problem which is an model for ice sheets and glaciers, namely the steady and isothermal shallow-ice approximation (SIA)  \cite{Bueleretal2005,Huybrechtsetal1996,vanderVeen2013}, in 1D for now.  We start by presenting the strong form of the model, a nonlinear complementarity problem (CP), and deriving the weak form, a nonlinear variational inequality (VI).

Starting with the data and parameters, we are given a signed \emph{surface mass balance} function $a(x)$, of size roughly $O(1)$ meters per year, and a \emph{bed elevation} (topography) function $b(x)$ in meters above sea level, and both are assumed to be time-independent.  Let $n>1$ be the (Glen) power, $\rhoi$ the ice density, and $g$ the acceleration of gravity.  Assuming isothermal conditions \cite{GreveBlatter2009}, let $A$ be the (constant) ice softness.\footnote{The values used in experiments are from \cite{Huybrechtsetal1996}: $n=3$, $\rhoi=910 \,\text{kg}\,\text{m}^{-3}$, $g=9.81 \,\text{m}\,\text{s}^{-2}$, and $A=10^{-16} \,\text{Pa}^n\,\text{a}^{-1}$.}  These positive parameters combine into a convenience constant $\Gamma = 2 A (\rhoi g)^n / (n+2)$.

The SIA equation determines the \emph{ice surface elevation} $s(x)$, also in meters above sea level, on the part of the domain where $s>b$:
\begin{equation}
- \left(\Gamma (s-b)^{n+2} |s'|^{n-1} s'\right)' = a.  \label{eq:sia}
\end{equation}
However, exactly as in section \ref{sec:obstacle}, this strong form is actually a CP:
\begin{align}
s - b &\ge 0, \label{eq:siacp} \\
- \left(\Gamma (s-b)^{n+2} |s'|^{n-1} s'\right)' - a &\ge 0 \notag \\
(s-b) \left[-\left(\Gamma (s-b)^{n+2} |s'|^{n-1} s'\right)' - a\right] &= 0 \notag
\end{align}
Similar to CP \eqref{eq:obstaclecp}, this one applies on a fixed interval $[0,L]$, a superset of the glaciated area, with $L$ of order $O(10)$ to $O(1000)$ kilometers.  The data $a(x)$, $b(x)$ are defined on this entire interval.

Stating the weak form corresponding to \eqref{eq:siacp} requires choosing appropriate function spaces.  It helps to refer to a simpler and better-understood, but still nonlinear, problem.  Let $\pp=n+1>2$ and consider the $\pp$-\emph{Laplacian equation} \cite{Ciarlet2002,DiBenedetto2012}.  The solution and test functions live in the Sobolev space of functions with zero boundary values and $L^\pp$-integrable first derivatives:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{W} = W_0^{1,\pp}[0,L]  \label{eq:defineW}
\end{equation}
The strong form of the equation is $-(|u'|^{\pp-2} u')' = f$ and the weak form is
\begin{equation}
\int_0^L |u'|^{\pp-2} u' v'\,dx = \int_0^L f v\,dx \text{ for all $v$ in $\mathcal{W}$.}  \label{eq:plaplacianpoisson}
\end{equation}
Equation \eqref{eq:plaplacianpoisson} is relatively well-understood because the calculus of variations can be applied; see \cite[section 5.3]{Ciarlet2002} and \cite{BarrettLiu1993}.  The corresponding obstacle problem for $\varphi$ in $\mathcal{W}$ is also well-behaved \cite{ChoeLewis1991}.  A unique solution $u$ in $\mathcal{W}$ exists as long as the source $f$ defines a bounded linear functional on $\mathcal{W}$, for which it suffices that $f$ is in $L^\qq[0,L]$, for $\pp^{-1}+\qq^{-1}=1$, and if the obstacle is in $\mathcal{W}$.  Note that in the $\pp>2$ case, corresponding to shear-thinning ice ($n>1$), the $\pp$-Laplacian operator is \emph{degenerate} \cite{DiBenedetto2012} in the sense that $|u'|^{\pp-2}$ may go to zero.

Returning to the SIA model, assume that $a$ is in $L^\qq[0,L]$ and $b$ is in $\mathcal{W}$, including $b(0)=b(L)=0$.  Tentatively we seek a solution $s$ from the admissible set
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{K}_b = \left\{v \ge b\right\} \subset \mathcal{W}.  \label{eq:siaK}
\end{equation}
Now assume $s$ is a well-behaved solution to CP \eqref{eq:siacp}, multiply \eqref{eq:sia} by a test function $v$ from $\mathcal{K}_b$, and integrate by parts.  A nonlinear operator $N:\mathcal{K}_b \to \mathcal{W}'$ appears, namely
\begin{equation}
N(s)[v] = \int_0^L \Gamma (s-b)^{\pp+1} |s'|^{\pp-2} s' v'\,dx. \label{eq:siaNunreg}
\end{equation}
(Regarding the powers, note $n+2=\pp+1$ and $n-1=\pp-2$.)  Then by application of the CP we derive our tentative weak form, the nonlinear VI
\begin{equation}
N(s)[v-s] \ge \ip{a}{v-s}, \label{eq:siaVIunreg}
\end{equation}
where $\ip{a}{v} = \int_0^L a(x) v(x)\,dx$ is the usual inner product (i.e.~dual pairing \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}).

Why is this at all ``tentative''?  It turns out that the correct function space for \eqref{eq:siaVIunreg} has not been identified, and actually $\mathcal{W}$ is inadequate.  This unfortunate situation, which we will not be able to fully resolve, requires some clarification, which we now attempt.

Whether written in strong form \eqref{eq:siacp} or weak form \eqref{eq:siaVIunreg}, the underlying SIA equation \eqref{eq:sia} has a well-known ``double nonlinearity'' \cite{Calvoetal2002}.  As a nonlinear elliptic equation, it has both porous medium \cite{Evans2010} and $\pp$-Laplacian types. The SIA operator \eqref{eq:siaNunreg} does not even uniformly act like the $\pp$-Laplacian because the coefficient $(s-b)^{\pp+1}$ may also degenerate to zero.  In fact, let $H=s-b$ be the \emph{ice thickness}.  Clearly the inequality constraint $s\ge b$ could be stated as the nonnegativity of thickness, $H\ge 0$, with the zero function as the obstacle, and indeed the model is stated this way in \cite{Bueler2016,JouvetBueler2012, Jouvetetal2013,JouvetGraeser2013}; see also \cite{Bueler2020}.  The nonlinear form $N(s)$ is therefore doubly-degenerate in that when either $H$ goes to zero or the surface slope $|s'|$ goes to zero there is a loss of ellipticity.

It follows from the double degeneracy that we do not expect the solution $s$ to \eqref{eq:siaVIunreg} to be in the Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}$.  For example, consider the flat-bed exact solution shown in Figure \ref{fig:siadatafigure}, which we will use for numerical testing.  (See section 5.6.3 of \cite{GreveBlatter2009} or section 5.3 of \cite{vanderVeen2013} for specific formulas.)  The continuous surface mass balance function $a(x)$, like the source term in the classical obstacle problem solution shown in Figure \ref{fig:icelike}, has negative values towards either end of the interval.  This generates a free boundary, i.e.~an ablation-caused \emph{glacier margin}, where the gradient is singular.  The continuous surface elevation $s(x)$ exactly solves \eqref{eq:sia} on $s>0$, and at the margin the ice flux goes to zero, but $s(x)$ is \emph{not} in $\mathcal{W}$ because its margin shape goes like $s(x) \sim |x-x_m|^{1/2}$ if $x_m$ is the position of the margin \cite{Bueleretal2005}.  (In the $L=1800$ km case shown, exact margin positions are $x_m=900\pm 750$ km.)  This shows VI \eqref{eq:siaVIunreg} cannot be the correct weak form.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{fixfigs/siadatafigure.pdf}
\caption{\emph{Top:} An exact solution $s(x)$ for a flat-bed ($b=0$) ice sheet.  \emph{Bottom:} The corresponding surface mass balance rate $a(x)$.}
\label{fig:siadatafigure}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, a weak solution of \eqref{eq:siaVIunreg} is known to exist in the sense that a power of the thickness, namely $u=H^{(2n+2)/n}$, is in $\mathcal{W}$ \cite{JouvetBueler2012}.  When $b=0$ the solution is unique, but in general uniqueness has not been established.  Unfortunately this transformed-thickness theory requires an awkward expression for the VI in the general-bed case.

In fact we are motivated to rescue weak form \eqref{eq:siaVIunreg} for the following three reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The SIA model is usually stated in terms of the surface elevation because the \emph{surface kinematical equation} (SKE) is used in its derivation \cite{GreveBlatter2009}.
\item Because the ice acts as a viscous fluid at scales of $O(10)$ meters and larger, the surface elevation $s$ of a real glacier or ice sheet is relatively smooth compared to the bed elevation $b$.  (Crevassing and other non-fluid surface effects like sastrugi are small in amplitude compared to bed elevation variations.)  Figure \ref{fig:giscross} shows a typical cross-section of the Greenland ice sheet.  While the bed elevation is full of high frequencies, reflecting ice-buried fjord topography, which also generates noisy thickness $H=s-b$, the surface is smoothed by the flow of the ice.
\item The key geometry-evolution equation in the Stokes model of section \ref{sec:stokes} is the SKE itself, stated in terms of $s$.  The momentum balance equation in the Stokes model requires the actual boundary geometry of the ice mass, as described using $s$ and $b$, and it permits no practical thickness-based formulation.
\end{enumerate}
Regarding item \emph{ii)}, we much prefer to apply smoothers and transfer operators to $s$, not $H$.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{genfigs/giscross.pdf}
\caption{\emph{Top.}  Cross-section of the Greenland ice sheet at $69^\circ$N latitude, showing surface $s$ and bed $b$.  \emph{Bottom.} The corresponding thickness $H=s-b$.  (Approximately $100\times$ vertical exaggeration in both parts.)}
\label{fig:giscross}
\end{figure}

With these considerations in mind we propose the following regularization of \eqref{eq:siaNunreg} and \eqref{eq:siaVIunreg}, from which we can conjecture a well-posedness theory for the SIA.  Let $\eps \ge 0$ be a small reference thickness.  Define $N_\eps:\mathcal{K}_b \to \mathcal{W}'$ by
\begin{equation}
N_\eps(s)[v] = \int_0^L \Gamma (s-b+\eps)^{\pp+1} |s'|^{\pp-2} s' v'\,dx. \label{eq:siaN}
\end{equation}
We say $s$ in $\mathcal{K}_b \subset \mathcal{W}$ \emph{solves the regularized SIA weak form} if it satisfies the corresponding nonlinear VI
\begin{equation}
N_\eps(s)[v-s] \ge \ip{a}{v-s} \label{eq:siaVI}
\end{equation}
for all $v$ in $\mathcal{K}_b$.  For each $\eps>0$ there should be a solution $s_\eps$ in $\mathcal{W}$, to \eqref{eq:siaVI}, perhaps unique in some circumstances.  We suppose this would be proved by a uniform-ellipticity argument relative to the corresponding $\pp$-Laplacian problem.  However, we do not expect the $\eps\to 0$ limit of $s_\eps$ to be in $\mathcal{W}$.  (In fact, the above exact solution is a case where $\|s_\eps\|_{\mathcal{W}} \to \infty$ as $\eps\to 0$, even though $\|N_\eps(s)\|_{\mathcal{W}'}$ has a finite limit.)  We expect that a limit $s(x)$ exists in the sense that $\|s_\eps-s\|_{L^\pp[0,L]}$ goes to zero, and pointwise.  This conjectured situation is consistent with all available numerical evidence, but we make no attempt to prove well-posedness by this or any other strategy.

By defining
\begin{equation}
F(s)[v] = N_\eps(s)[v] - \ip{a}{v}, \label{eq:siaF}
\end{equation}
the nonlinear VI \eqref{eq:siaVI} takes the form
\begin{equation}
F(s)[v-s] \ge 0 \quad \text{for all } v \text{ in } \mathcal{K}_b, \label{eq:siaVIresidual}
\end{equation}
the same as the classical obstacle problem VI \eqref{eq:obstacleviresidual}.  Regarding the intuition behind \eqref{eq:siaVIresidual}, see Figure \ref{fig:cartoonplane} and the accompanying text.  For general bed elevation data $b(x)$, note that the $F$ defined in \eqref{eq:siaF} is \emph{not} the gradient of a scalar objective functional.

In our numerical results we set $\eps=0$.  Thus the regularization is helpful in theory but not needed in practice.

\subsection{Nonlinear MCD cycles} \label{subsec:mcdn}  We now propose to apply a nonlinear form of the MCD method to the steady SIA VI problem \eqref{eq:siaVI}.  The method is a \emph{full approximation storage} (FAS) scheme, so it follows a well-known multilevel strategy for nonlinear PDEs \cite{Briggsetal2000,Trottenbergetal2001}, and it extends the MCDL method of section \ref{sec:obstacle}.  It reduces implementation complexity relative to methods which track the inactive set \cite{Bueler2016,Jouvetetal2013,JouvetGraeser2013}, and leads to robust and scalable numerical solutions.

Suppose our fine-level FE space is $\mathcal{V}^J \subset \mathcal{W}$, the space of continuous piecewise-linear functions with zero boundary values.  Suppose $b^J$ in $\mathcal{V}^J$ is the fine-level interpolant of the continuum bed $b$.  Assume $s$ in $\mathcal{W}$ solves \eqref{eq:siaVI}, for some $\eps>0$, and assume that our given iterate $w^J\approx s$, with $w^J$ in $\mathcal{V}^J$, is admissible in the sense that $w^J \ge b^J$.  As in section \ref{sec:obstacle}, we now define the fine-level defect constraint function and set:
    $$\chi^J = b^J - w^J, \qquad \mathcal{D}^J = \{v\ge \chi^J\} \subset \mathcal{V}^J.$$
Recall that a perturbed iterate is admissible, $w^J + z^J \ge b^J$, if and only if the perturbation $z^J$ is in $\mathcal{D}^J$.  Let $N^J$ be an FE approximation of the nonlinear operator $N_\eps$ in \eqref{eq:siaN}.  (The construction of $N^J$ occurs in the next subsection \ref{subsec:Ndiscretization}.)  Let $\ell^J[v] = \ip{a}{v}$.  Our goal is to solve the fine-level FE version of VI \eqref{eq:siaVI} for an admissible perturbation $z^J$ in $\mathcal{D}^J$.  That is, we want to solve
\begin{equation}
N^J(w^J+z^J)[v-z^J] \ge \ell^J[v-z^J] \quad \text{for all $v$ in $\mathcal{D}^J$.} \label{eq:siaVIFEfinelevel}
\end{equation}
Note that $s^J=w^J+z^J$ is the desired surface elevation result, and that $v - z^J = (w^J+v)-s^J$.

Finite-dimensional nonlinear VI \eqref{eq:siaVIFEfinelevel} suffices when applying a single-level method.  However, for a multi-level method, using the fundamental MCD idea from section \ref{sec:obstacle} we split the coarse-level correction $z^J$ into admissible parts by splitting-up the defect constraint set.  Recalling $\mR$ denotes the monotone restriction operator \eqref{eq:monotonerestriction} (Table \ref{tab:transfers}), for $j=1,\dots,J$ let
    $$\chi^{j-1} = \mR \chi^j, \qquad \phi^j = \chi^j - \chi^{j-1},$$
and define $\chi^{-1}=0$ so that $\phi^0=\chi^0$.  Note that the telescoping-sum decomposition \eqref{eq:telescopingdecomposition} holds.  For $j=0,\dots,J$ let
    $$\mathcal{D}^j = \{v \ge \chi^j\}, \qquad \mathcal{K}^j = \{v \ge \phi^j\}$$
be the up- and down-admissible subsets of $\mathcal{V}^j$, respectively.  Note that $\mathcal{D}^j = \sum_{k=0}^j \mathcal{K}^k$ for any $j$, and that Figure \ref{fig:gooddecomposition} serves as a visualization if $\varphi^J$ is replaced by $b^J$.

Suppose we have admissible perturbations of $w^J$ down to the $j+1$ level which \emph{approximately} satisfy \eqref{eq:siaVIFEfinelevel}.  Specifically, suppose $y^{j+1},\dots,y^J$ in $\mathcal{K}^{j+1},\dots,\mathcal{K}^J$ have been computed, using smoothers as described in the subsection \ref{subsec:pngs}, so that $z^{j+1}=y^{j+1}+\dots+y^J$ approximately solves \eqref{eq:siaVIFEfinelevel}.  We now seek a coarser-level correction $y$ in $\mathcal{K}^j$ so that
\begin{equation}
N^{j+1}(w^J+z^{j+1}+y)[v-y] \ge \ell^{j+1}[v-y] \label{eq:siaVIFEprecoarseone}
\end{equation}
for all $v$ in $\mathcal{K}^j$.  (The source $\ell^{j+1}$ is defined later, but note $\ell^J[v] = \ip{a}{v}$.)  Subtracting $N^{j+1}(w^J+z^{j+1})$ from both sides of \eqref{eq:siaVIFEprecoarseone},
\begin{equation}
N^{j+1}(w^J+z^{j+1}+y)[v-y] - N^{j+1}(w^J+z^{j+1})[v-y] \ge - \tilde F^{j+1}[v-y], \label{eq:siaVIFEprecoarsetwo}
\end{equation}
reveals a residual
\begin{equation}
\tilde F^{j+1}[v] = N^{j+1}(w^J+z^{j+1})[v] - \ell^{j+1}[v].
\end{equation}

The effect of the smoothers on the $J$ down to $j+1$ levels should be to make $\tilde F^{j+1}$ smooth in a CP residual \eqref{eq:cpresidual} sense, and thus VI \eqref{eq:siaVIFEprecoarsetwo} should be accurately-representable on the $j$th level.  Thus we want to approximate it using only using the $j$th-level basis.  To do this we define \emph{injection restriction} $\iR:\mathcal{V}^{j+1} \to \mathcal{V}^j$ (Table \ref{tab:transfers}), which simply keeps the values of the solution at the coarse-level nodes and discards the fine-level nodes in between:
\begin{equation}
  (\iR v)_p = v_{2p}, \label{eq:injectionrestriction}
\end{equation}
for $p=1,\dots,m_j$.  Note that $\iR$ preserves admissibility relative to the interpolated bed elevation data on each level: $v\ge b^{j+1} \implies \iR v \ge b^j$.  Next we define $g^j$ as the current $j$th-level approximation to the solution $s$:
\begin{equation}
g^j = \begin{cases} w^J, & j=J \\
                    \iR(g^{j+1} + y^{j+1}), & j < J.
      \end{cases}  \label{eq:siag}
\end{equation}
That is, $g^j$ is our estimate of the solution on the $j$th level, before we add a correction which solves a VI on the $j$th level.

We can now be completely precise about the $j$th-level VI.  Given the next-finer correction $y^{j+1}$, and using \eqref{eq:siag} to define $g^j$ from $g^{j+1}$, let
\begin{equation}
\ell^j[v] = \begin{cases} \ip{a}{v}, & j=J \\
                          N^j(g^j)[v] - R \left(N^{j+1}(g^{j+1}+y^{j+1}) - \ell^{j+1}\right)[v], & j < J.
            \end{cases}  \label{eq:siaell}
\end{equation}
(Such a source term appears in a standard FAS scheme for PDEs \cite{Trottenbergetal2001}.)  Note this definition uses canonical restriction $R$ (Table \ref{tab:transfers}).  From \eqref{eq:siaVIFEprecoarsetwo}, our $j$th-level correction VI is
\begin{equation}
N^j(g^j+y)[v-y^j] - N^j(g^j)[v-y^j] \ge - R \left(N^{j+1}(g^{j+1}+y^{j+1}) - \ell^{j+1}\right)[v-y^j]. \label{eq:siaVIFEFASearly}
\end{equation}
We can clean-up the appearance by collecting known terms on the right and using definition \eqref{eq:siaell}.  Thus we seek a correction $y^j$ in $\mathcal{K}^j$ so that
\begin{equation}
N^j(g^j+y^j)[v-y^j] \ge \ell^j[v-y^j] \quad \text{for all $v$ in $\mathcal{K}^j$.} \label{eq:siaVIFEFAS}
\end{equation}

From \eqref{eq:siag}, \eqref{eq:siaell}, and \eqref{eq:siaVIFEFAS} we can construct a V-cycle comparable to \pr{mcdl-vcycle} in section \ref{sec:obstacle}.  On descent we look for corrections $y^j$ from the down-admissible sets $\mathcal{K}^j$, but going upward we allow corrections $z^j$ from the larger up-admissible sets $\mathcal{D}^j$; see Figure \ref{fig:mcdvcycle}.

The nonlinear operator $N^j$  is defined in the next subsection \ref{subsec:Ndiscretization}, and the \pr{pngs} smoother in subsection \ref{subsec:pngs}.  We may also apply nested iteration to generate the initial iterate on the finest level, for which the following is a small modification of \pr{mcdl-fcycle} in section \ref{sec:obstacle}.

(As before, $b^j$ denotes the $j$th-level interpolant of $b(x)$.)  In general we will iterate \pr{mcdn-vcycle} until the norm of the CP residual has been reduced by a tolerance factor; compare the following to \pr{mcdl-solver}.

% FIXME possible: $\mR$ generates a coarse-level thickness coefficient that is better than in \eqref{eq:siaVIFEFAS}; on the coarse level the nonlinear operator is slightly different; it is more ``$\pp$-Laplacian elliptic''

\subsection{Nonlinear operator discretization} \label{subsec:Ndiscretization}  The discretization of SIA VI \eqref{eq:siaVI}, to generate either the single-level form \eqref{eq:siaVIFEfinelevel} or the coarse-level correction form \eqref{eq:siaVIFEFAS}, proceeds essentially as for the classical obstacle problem VI \eqref{eq:obstacleviresidual}.  Compared to the discretization of the Laplacian operator and bilinear form, there are two significant differences when we discretize $N_\eps$ in \eqref{eq:siaN}:
\begin{itemize}
\item the bed elevation $b$ appears in the formula, not just in defining the admissible sets, and
\item we approximate the integral using quadrature.
\end{itemize}

Suppose $w^j$ in $\mathcal{V}^j \subset \mathcal{W}$ is an iterate on the $j$th level, an approximation of the surface elevation $s_\eps$ which solves \eqref{eq:siaVI}, expanded in hat functions $w^j = \sum w_q \psi_q^j$.  Because the support of $\psi_p^j$ is the interval $[x_p^j-h,x_p^j+h]$, the exact value of the nonlinear operator acting on $w^j$ is
\begin{equation}
N_\eps(w^j)[\psi_p^j] = \int_{x_p^j-h}^{x_p^j+h} \Gamma (w^j-b+\eps)^{\pp+1} \left|(w^j)'\right|^{\pp-2} (w^j)'\, (\psi_p^j)'\,dx.  \label{eq:siaNFEgoal}
\end{equation}

Let us define functions for the powers appearing above:
\begin{equation}
\tau_q(\xi)  = (\xi - b_q + \eps)^{\pp+1}, \qquad \mu(\xi) = |\xi|^{\pp-2} \xi, \label{eq:siahelperfcns}
\end{equation}
for domains $\xi \ge b_q$ and $\xi$ in $\RR$, respectively.  These functions are continuously-differentiable with nonnegative derivatives $\mu'(\xi) = (\pp-1) |\xi|^{\pp-2}$ and $\tau_q'(\xi) = (\pp+1) (\xi-b_q + \eps)^{\pp}$, respectively.  Note that $\tau_q$ uses a nodal bed elevation $b_q$, and indeed we will approximate $N_\eps$ using the interpolated bed $b^j$.  Observe that exact integration of \eqref{eq:siaNFEgoal} is impossible for non-integer $\pp$, and tedious for integer values, so our approximation the piecewise-linearity of the functions and the trapezoid rule on each element:
\begin{align}
N^j(w^j)[\psi_p^j] &= \Gamma \left(\frac{\tau_{p-1}(w_{p-1}) + \tau_p(w_p)}{2}\right) \mu\left(\frac{w_p-w_{p-1}}{h}\right)\, \frac{+1}{h}\, h \notag \\
    &\qquad\quad  + \Gamma \left(\frac{\tau_p(w_p) + \tau_{p+1}(w_{p+1})}{2}\right) \mu\left(\frac{w_{p+1}-w_p}{h}\right)\, \frac{-1}{h}\, h, \notag \\
    &= \frac{\Gamma}{2h^{\pp-1}} \Big[(\tau_{p-1}(w_{p-1}) + \tau_p(w_p)) \mu(w_p-w_{p-1})  \label{eq:siaNlevel} \\
    &\qquad\qquad\quad - (\tau_p(w_p) + \tau_{p+1}(w_{p+1})) \mu(w_{p+1}-w_p)\Big]. \notag
\end{align}
This defines a map from $w^j$ in $\{v \ge b^j\} \subset \mathcal{V}^j$ to $N^j(w^j) \approx N_\eps(w^j)$ in $(\mathcal{V}^j)'$.

For convergence and performance comparisons versus the more-degenerate SIA problem, will also solve the $\pp$-Laplacian obstacle problem.  Its operator formula, implicit the weak form \eqref{eq:plaplacianpoisson}, is computed exactly using \eqref{eq:siaNlevel}, but with $\Gamma = 1$ and $\tau_q(\xi)=1$: $N^j(w^j)[\psi_p^j] = h^{1-\pp} \left[\mu(w_p-w_{p-1}) - \mu(w_{p+1}-w_p)\right]$.

\subsection{Projected nonlinear smoothers} \label{subsec:pngs}  To construct smoothers for VI \eqref{eq:siaVIFEfinelevel} or \eqref{eq:siaVIFEFAS} we follow the derivation of the PGS smoother in section \ref{sec:obstacle}.  Although a minimization-based derivation was possible for that classical obstacle problem, we also showed that one-dimensional VI \eqref{eq:pgspointwisevi} produced the PGS formula \eqref{eq:pgsformula}, and the smoothers here will again use a one-dimensional VI.  However, because the problem is nonlinear it will take a fixed number of Newton steps at each point, and where the SIA form degenerates we need special logic.  We describe how to apply a smoother for \eqref{eq:siaVIFEFAS}, and later note the simple replacements for \eqref{eq:siaVIFEfinelevel}.

In \eqref{eq:siaVIFEFAS}, assuming we are going down in a V-cycle, $\phi^j$ is the obstacle on the $j$th level, with expansion $\phi^j = \sum \phi_q \psi_q^j$, and $\mathcal{K}^j = \{v \ge \phi^j\} \subset \mathcal{V}^j \subset \mathcal{W}$.  Note that $g^j+y^j \ge b^j$ follows if $y^j$ is in $\mathcal{K}^j$.  At the node $x_p^j$, our smoother will seek a scalar $c$ so that $c \ge \phi_p - y_p$ and it solves the following one-dimensional VI:
\begin{equation}
N^j(g^j+y^j+c\psi_p^j)[(\tilde c - c) \psi_p^j] \ge \ell^j[(\tilde c - c) \psi_p^j] \label{eq:pngspointwiseviEARLY}
\end{equation}
for all scalars $\tilde c$ such that $\tilde c \ge \phi_p - y_p$.
(Note that $(\tilde c - c) \psi_p^j = (g^j+y^j+\tilde c\psi_p^j) - (g^j+y^j+c\psi_p^j)$.)  By linearity we may write this as
\begin{equation}
  (\tilde c - c) \rho(c) \ge 0,  \label{eq:pngspointwisevi}
\end{equation}
where, using \eqref{eq:siaNlevel} to identify the power functions $\tau_q$ and $\mu$ from \eqref{eq:siahelperfcns}, and defining $w_p=g_p+y_p$ and $\ell_p=\ell^j[\psi_p^j]$, we have the following scalar \emph{pointwise residual} function
\begin{align}
  \rho(c) &= N^j(g^j+y^j+c\psi_p^j)[\psi_p^j] - \ell^j[\psi_p^j] \label{eq:pngspointwiseresidual} \\
       &= \frac{\Gamma}{2h^{\pp-1}} \Big[(\tau_{p-1}(w_{p-1}) + \tau_p(w_p +c)) \mu(w_p+c-w_{p-1}) \notag  \\
       &\hspace{20mm} - (\tau_p(w_p+c) + \tau_{p+1}(w_{p+1})) \mu(w_{p+1}-w_p-c)\Big] - \ell_p. \notag
\end{align}
In using this formula keep in mind that $w^j = g^j+y^j$ is the current estimate of the ice surface, but $g^j$ is fixed while $y^j$ is the actual solution variable.

Now, the pointwise residual $\rho(c)$ is differentiable on $[\phi_p - y_p,+\infty)$, an interval which always includes $c=0$.  When we derived \eqref{eq:pgspointwisevi} we used the fact that the corresponding pointwise residual was both linear and strictly-increasing, from which it followed that the solution of one-dimensional VI \eqref{eq:pgspointwisevi} was either the unique value $c$ in the admissible interval which made the scalar function zero, or it was the left endpoint of the interval.  Here we would ``want'' $\rho'(c)$ in \eqref{eq:pngspointwiseresidual} to always be positive, indeed it would be nice if it were bounded away from zero by uniform ellipticity.  However, this is not true in either the SIA or $\pp$-Laplacian problem (if $\pp>2$).  As noted above (subsection \ref{subsec:siaproblem}), our SIA nonlinear operator $N(w)$ degenerates in two different ways, so we must proceed carefully to construct a robust smoother.

Lower bounds on the derivative $\rho'(c)$ are possible.  By the product rule, the mean value theorem, the fact that $\tau_q(x) = (x+b_q+\eps)^{\pp+1} \ge \eps^{\pp+1}$ when $x\ge b_q$, and that fact that $\mu'\ge 0$,
\begin{align}
  \rho'(c) &= \frac{\Gamma}{2h^{\pp-1}} \Big[\tau_p'(w_p+c) \left(\mu(w_p+c-w_{p-1}) -  \mu(w_{p+1}-w_p-c)\right) \label{eq:pngsderivativebound} \\
        &\qquad\qquad\quad + (\tau_{p-1}(w_{p-1}) + \tau_p(w_p+c)) \mu'(w_p+c-w_{p-1}) \notag \\
        &\qquad\qquad\quad + (\tau_p(w_p+c) + \tau_{p+1}(w_{p+1})) \mu'(w_{p+1}-w_p-c)\Big] \notag \\
        &\ge \frac{\Gamma}{2h^{\pp-1}} \Big[\tau_p'(w_p+c) \mu'(\xi_p) (2(w_p+c) - w_{p-1} - w_{p+1}) \notag \\
        &\qquad\qquad\quad + 2 \eps^{\pp+1} \left(\mu'(w_p+c-w_{p-1}) + \mu'(w_{p+1}-w_p-c)\right)\Big] \notag \\
        &\ge \frac{\Gamma}{2h^{\pp-1}} \tau_p'(w_p+c) \mu'(\xi_p) (2(w_p+c) - w_{p-1} - w_{p+1}) \notag
\end{align}
(Note that taking $\eps=0$ does not change the final bound.)  Recalling that $\tau_q'$ is also nonnegative, $\rho'(c)$ can be negative only when
    $$0 > 2(w_p+c) - w_{p-1} - w_{p+1} \approx - h^2\left(w^j(x) + c \psi_p^j(x)\right)''\Big|_{x_p^j},$$
that is, when the updated surface $w^j(x) + c \psi_p^j(x)$ is convex (concave up) at $x_p^j$.  This situation is most likely to occur when $x_p^j$ is the estimated margin location.

Lower bound \eqref{eq:pngsderivativebound} also applies in the easier $\pp$-Laplacian case.  Then $\Gamma=1$ and $\tau_q(\xi)=1$ (constant) so we have $\rho'(c)\ge 0$, but $\rho'(c)$ is again not bounded away from zero.

Unlike the corresponding problem for the classical obstacle problem, the solution of \eqref{eq:pngspointwisevi} cannot be found exactly.  Instead we set up a Newton iteration to compute $y^j$ pointwise, which in simple form would say
\begin{equation}
    c = -\rho(0) / \rho'(0), \qquad y_p \gets y_p + c. \label{eq:pngspointNewton}
\end{equation}
However, because $\rho'(0)$ may be arbitrarily small or even zero, each such Newton step must be protected.  In the case where $\rho'(0)=0$ exactly, the flow is not telling us anything about how the current surface should move, and indeed this usually happens at ice-free locations.  If $\ell_p > 0$ and we are at an ice-free location then accumulation is occurring, and we simply increase the surface by a fixed, small distance \id{caccum}, with default value 10 m.  Otherwise we leave $c=0$.  On the other hand, if $\rho'(0)$ is small then we compute $c$.  In the case that $c$ is large and positive we limit it by \id{cupmax}, with large default value 5000 m, while if $c$ is negative we limit it (as usual) by enforcing admissiblity.  Note that the downward limitation is intrinsic to one-sided obstacle problems, but the upward limitation relates to the failure of uniform ellipticity.

For clarity we isolate this logic into a pseudocode.  Consider a point $x_p^j$ and note we seek $c$ in the interval $[\phi_p-y_p,+\infty)$.  We assume $r=\rho(0)$ and $\delta=\rho'(0)$ have already been computed at the point.
\begin{pseudo*} \label{ps:pointupdate}
\pr{pointupdate}(r,\delta,\phi_p,y_p,\ell_p,\id{cupmax}=5000\, m,\id{caccum}=10\, m)\text{:} \\+
    if $\delta = 0$ \\+
        if $\ell_p > 0$ and $y_p = 0$ \\+
            return \id{caccum}  \qquad\qquad\quad \ct{move upward if accumulation at ice-free} \\-
        else \\+
            return $0$ \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \ct{no information on how to move} \\--
    else \\+
        $c = - r / \delta$ \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \ct{pure Newton step} \\
        $c = \max(c, \phi_p-y_p)$ \qquad\qquad\qquad\, \ct{ensure admissibility} \\
        return $\min(c, \id{cupmax})$ \qquad\qquad\quad \ct{limit large upward steps}
\end{pseudo*}

If the pointwise problems are done with all the current values of the iterate then our smoother is \emph{projected nonlinear Gauss-Seidel} (PNGS).  For either the SIA or $\pp$-Laplacian problems we have the following pseudocode.
\begin{pseudo*} \label{ps:pngs}
\pr{pngs}(j,g^j,y^j,N^j,\ell^j,\phi^j,\id{newtonits}=2,\id{omega}=1)\text{:} \\+
    \ct{check admissibility: $y^j \ge \phi^j$} \\
    for $p=1,\dots,m_j$ \\+
        for $k=1,\dots,\id{newtonits}$ \\+
            $\rho(c) := N^j(g^j+y^j+c\psi_p^j)[\psi_p^j] - \ell^j[\psi_p^j]$ \\
            $c = \pr{pointupdate}(\rho(0), \rho'(0),\phi_p,y_p,\ell_p)$ \\
            $y_p \gets y_p + \id{omega}\,c$
\end{pseudo*}
As before there is a \emph{projected nonlinear Jacobi} version.  In this case the loops are reversed because the residual and Jacobian must be updated before each sweep.
\begin{pseudo*} \label{ps:pnjacobi}
\pr{pnjacobi}(j,g^j,y^j,N^j,\ell^j,\phi^j,\id{newtonits}=2,\id{omega}=0.67)\text{:} \\+
    \ct{check admissibility: $y^j \ge \phi^j$} \\
    for $k=1,\dots,\id{newtonits}$ \\+
        $\rho_p(c) := N^j(g^j+y^j+c\psi_p^j)[\psi_p^j] - \ell^j[\psi_p^j]$ \\
        $r_p, \delta_p = \rho_p(0), \rho_p'(0)$ \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \ct{compute for all $p$}\\
        for $p=1,\dots,m_j$ \\+
            $c = \pr{pointupdate}(r_p, \delta_p,\phi_p,y_p,\ell_p)$ \\
            $y_p \gets y_p + \id{omega}\,c$
\end{pseudo*}
Here the default value of \id{omega} is just a place-holder, because stable values must be determined by experimentation.

For single-level VI \eqref{eq:siaVIFEfinelevel}, or for \eqref{eq:siaVIFEFAS} when up-smoothing after the coarse-level correction, make the following replacements in formulas and pseudocodes: $\phi^j \to \chi^j$, $\mathcal{K}^j \to \mathcal{D}^j$, $y^j \to z^j$.

The above formulas and pseudocodes also apply to the $\pp$-Laplacian obstacle problem---see \eqref{eq:plaplacianpoisson}---with only minimal modifications as follows: $\Gamma=1$ and $\tau_q(\xi)=1$ in formulas for $N(w)[v]$ and $\rho(c)$; \id{cupmax} $=1$ and \id{caccum} $=0$ in the $\pp$-Laplacian implementation of \pr{pointupdate}.

\subsection{Convergence and performance results} \label{subsec:siaperformance}  FIXME convergence in Figure \ref{fig:siaconv}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{genfigs/siaconv.pdf}

\end{figure}

We can compare the above results to $\pp$-Laplacian convergence for the $\pp$-Laplacian obstacle problem, with $\pp=4$, on an exact solution constructed in a similar way to the classical obstacle problem shown in Figure \ref{fig:icelike}.  In that case we measure $\|u-u_{\text{exact}}\|_\pp=O(h^{0.99})$, and as for the SIA case the numerical error norms are not monotonic.  The fact that $\|H^\rr-H_{\text{exact}}^\rr\|_\pp$ goes to zero at a slightly-better rate for the SIA solution reflects the fact that the source term for the SIA is continuous while for the $\pp$-Laplacian solution it is not.
